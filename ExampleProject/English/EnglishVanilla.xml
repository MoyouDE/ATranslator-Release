<!-- Loading Screen tips -->
<loadingscreentip>You will not get paid for delivering cargo if any of the cargo goes missing or gets damaged during the transport.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Generating more power than the devices in the submarine are consuming may damage junction boxes or cause fires.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Junction boxes and other electrical devices may get damaged if they stay submerged too long.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Letting the submarine's nuclear reactor overheat may cause fires. If an overheated reactor is not shut down, it will eventually lead to a nuclear meltdown.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Most submarines are equipped with stationary batteries that can be used as a temporary source of backup power in the case of a reactor failure.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Railgun shells and depth charges include a compartment that can hold additional explosives.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Passive sonar can be used to detect nearby sound sources without attracting unwanted attention. You can also get a rough idea of your surroundings based on the sounds reflected from the ice walls.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>There are many ways to get past locked doors, including forcing them open with a crowbar or rewiring them to a button you have access to.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Stationary batteries are equipped with docks that can be used to charge battery cells.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Oxygen generators are equipped with docks that can be used to refill oxygen tanks.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Supercapacitors can deliver large bursts of power, but cannot store as much energy as batteries. They are often used to power railguns and other devices that require brief bursts of high current.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Nuclear reactors are equipped with an automatic control system that adjusts the power output to a suitable level when enabled. However, the system is not always fast enough to react to large fluctuations in power consumption.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The sonar imaging on the navigation terminal may become inaccurate if the terminal is damaged—make sure your engineers keep the terminal in a good condition!</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>When deploying a decoy, be sure to deactivate your active sonar for best results.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Attempting to rewire powered devices without adequate electrical engineering skills may get you electrocuted.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Welding tools are simple enough to be used by any submariner, but trained mechanics are generally faster welders and have a lower risk of injuring themselves with the tool.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>All submariners have been trained to do basic repairs on electrical devices, but electrical engineers get the job done much faster.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>All submariners have been trained to do basic repairs on mechanical devices, but mechanics get the job done much faster.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Captains are generally much more adept at maneuvering the submarine than the average sailor.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>If the reactor on a sub is not able to produce sufficient power to run all onboard systems, try reducing the charge rate for the onboard batteries and supercapacitors, or regulate the times when the sub is running at full speed.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The electrical and mechanical systems on a sub will gradually degrade due to the harsh conditions and constant wear and tear. Be sure to have mechanics and engineers perform maintenance from time to time in order to avoid breakdowns at inopportune moments.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Breaking down alien artifacts in a deconstructor may provide you with exotic raw materials.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Some of the alien structures on Europa have been constructed of a metamaterial that's outstandingly resistant to physical damage, and as such has become an important subject of research to Europan scientists.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Special caution must be taken when bringing alien artifacts on board the submarine.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Very little is known of the presumably extinct alien civilization that built the ruins scattered all across Europa. The age of the ruins is also a mystery, since the self-repairing properties of the structures and devices make chronological dating methods wildly inaccurate.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>No remains of the alien lifeforms that built the ruins scattered all across Europa have ever been discovered. The only life encountered inside the structures are the biomechanical entities that maintain and guard them.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>While exploring ruins or caves, drop flares as often as possible to help mark a path out, should you need to make a hasty exit for some reason.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Watchers are docile but inquisitive creatures: Despite having no desire to attack submarines, they frequently approach ships to gaze at human activities.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Cannibalistic behavior is very common among crawlers. Killing one in a swarm may distract the rest as they enter into a feeding frenzy.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Mudraptors can easily tear their way through metal doors with their sharp beaks.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The so-called husk parasites slowly take over and consume the body of their host, eventually turning them into nothing but an empty exoskeleton controlled by the parasite.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Many creatures on Europa are protected by a strong shell, and are difficult to damage with conventional weapons, though there may be weak points in their armor.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Loud devices and sonar pings may alert nearby creatures.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Performing CPR without adequate medical skills may cause internal damage to the patient.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Opiates such as morphine and fentanyl are an effective way of treating injuries in an emergency, but regular use may eventually lead to a state of addiction and cause dangerous withdrawal symptoms.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Bleeding wounds can be treated with bandages and hemostatic agents. The patient may also need saline or blood packs to replace the lost blood.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Mental disorders such as psychosis are unfortunately common among submarine crews, particularly after ruin expeditions. If your crewmates start seeing or hearing things others don't see or hear, report it to a medical doctor immediately.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The medical doctors' main task is to keep the crew in a good shape, but a medic with a syringe gun and a bit of knowhow on poisons can also be very useful in fending off intruders.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Many drugs may have unintended side effects. Keep an eye on the patient and be ready to administer additional medications to counteract these side effects if necessary.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>When using a diving mask, be careful not to mix up welding fuel tanks and oxygen tanks.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Diving masks let you breathe underwater, but don't offer any protection against the bone-crushing pressure outside the submarine. If there's a major hull breach, find a diving suit immediately.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>In the event of a fire, burns are not the only thing to watch out for—fires can quickly consume all the oxygen inside the submarine.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Traversing the so-called Hydrothermal Wastes requires special caution. Not only are they abundant in wildlife, but the water currents caused by geothermal activity make navigation even more hazardous.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Some of the sessile lifeforms in Europa emit low-frequency sounds that may disrupt the submarine's sonar.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Europa is rich in natural resources, and an enterprising captain with a sharp eye and a plasma cutter may stand to make a tidy profit.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>You can disguise yourself as someone else by wearing their ID card and something that covers your face.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>It's possible to build voice-controlled systems by linking wifi components to the radio chat in the submarine editor.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The radiation belts around Jupiter make it impracticable to establish permanent settlements above Europa's surface, and as such almost all Europan outposts are located below its icy crust.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The dynamics of Europa's underwater ecosystem are still not fully understood, but it is believed that the base of the food chain is mostly formed by chemosynthetic bacteria.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The Europa Coalition started off as a trade and cooperation agreement between the two largest Europan settlements and a handful of private paramilitary groups, but gradually grew to become what is essentially the Europan government.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The much-ridiculed initiative to help submariners cope in a high-stress environment by including professional entertainers in the crews was promptly deemed a failure and discontinued.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Most vessels avoid venturing outside the tunnels and cracks within Europa's icy crust—the vast, empty Abyss between the surface layers and the rocky interior hosts many of Europa's largest and most dangerous inhabitants.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>If left undisturbed for several years, a colony of ballast flora can eventually grow into a Thalamus, an intelligent organism capable of exerting some degree of control over the systems of the submarine it's inhabiting.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>You can give context-sensitive commands when the cursor is over a usable object by holding down shift and opening the command interface.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Making trouble at an outpost hurts your reputation. A bad reputation might cause the inhabitants of the outpost to charge you a premium for their services, or, in more extreme cases, lead to a confrontation with their security.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Many Europan outposts don't recognize the Coalition's authority, although it is still powerful enough that few dare to openly oppose it. However, there are groups such as the Jovian Separatists who do fight against it, aiming to bring it down and create a more democratic society.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Behold the Watcher. Don't lose your mind.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Straddling the border between surface ice and the denser, rockier subsurface ice layer, the Europan Ridge is the area along the western-most slope of the Eye of Europa. Warmer water is convected into this area, allowing a wider array of life to subsist.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The Aphotic Plateau sits atop the western rim of an ancient impact crater known as the Eye of Europa. As with the neighboring Europan Ridge, the Plateau’s tunnel networks consist mostly of dark, rocky ice pressed as hard as any stone by the unimaginable weight of the ice above it.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Most of the human habitation on Europa is situated in the so-called Cold Caverns. Due to the cold water and relative proximity to the surface, this biome is biologically less diverse than others, primarily hosting moderate concentrations of crawlers and practically no vegetation.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Ice spires are enormous icy projections that sometimes burst through the subsurface tunnels under Europa's crust. Submarine crews are advised to avoid any contact with the spires, or to destroy any they come across, as the sharp edges can easily tear through a submarine's hull.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The poorly understood "Piezo Crystals" found in The Great Sea pose some extra challenges to crews travelling through the region: Navigating too close to one may cause disruptions in the submarine's electrical grid.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Administering drugs without sufficient medical knowledge may reduce the quality of the effects of the drug.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Generating more power than your sub's devices require leads to overvoltage, which can be used to push some devices (such as engines and pumps) past their normal capacity. However, a too-high voltage level may also damage devices.</loadingscreentip>

You may want to go through the light sources and disable shadow casting where possible: Dim and/or low-range static lights don't necessarily need to cast shadows if letting the light go through walls and doors is not noticeable, and lights outside the submarine can be set to be drawn behind the submarine so shadows don't need to be cast.</subeditor.shadowcastinglightswarning>

<entitydescription.safeandsoundsecurity101>An official set of guidelines for dealing with traitorous crewmates.</entitydescription.safeandsoundsecurity101>
<securityofficer.traitor.guidelines>Officer Pérez's Safe and Sound Security 101\n\nHostile factions and individuals are known to offer submariners bribes or other compensation for committing unlawful acts. This is unfortunately so common that throwing every traitorous submariner out the airlock would be detrimental to the submarine fleets and the Europan labor force as a whole. The Code of Fair Disciplinary Actions provides guidelines for dealing with traitors or other troublesome crewmates in a just manner.\n\nLevel 1 Offenses:\nDescription: mostly harmless misdemeanors, "pranks," neglect of assigned duties. Acts that at most cause minor inconvenience to the rest of the crew.\nSuggested disciplinary actions: Notify the person of their misconduct and command them back to their duties. A baton or some other non-lethal tool may be used to accentuate the verbal commands. More severe disciplinary actions can be considered if the misconduct continues.\n\nLevel 2 Offenses:\nDescription: acts that may endanger the health of the crew or submarine, such as intentional mishandling of devices or substances.\nSuggested disciplinary actions: Similar to level 1 offenses, a simple disciplining can suffice, but depending on the misconduct security can deem it necessary to instead handcuff or detain the individual by other means\n\nLevel 3 Offenses:\nDescription: clearly hostile acts with the intention to cause severe injuries or the death of one or more crewmates.\nSuggested disciplinary actions: Disposing of the traitor as soon as possible is advised. The disposal should preferably be carried out in a humane way, but it is understandable if such means are not available or feasible for one reason or another.</securityofficer.traitor.guidelines>

<!-- Submarine names & descriptions -->
<submarine.name.humpback>Humpback</submarine.name.humpback>
<submarine.description.humpback>A former military vessel, WH4-L3 "Humpback" has been outfitted to withstand most of the dangers in deep Europa. Her relatively high velocity is offset by low maneuverability. As she's still boasting an older model reactor, power needs to be supplemented by a backup battery array or the crew will find themselves unable to run all of the new equipment.</submarine.description.humpback>
<submarine.name.bunyip>Bunyip</submarine.name.bunyip>
<submarine.description.bunyip>Latest in the line of personnel transports, Bunyip is capable of ferrying crew between submarines and installations. Its operating radius is considerably lower than its more advanced cousins and no weapons on board makes it vulnerable to attacks.</submarine.description.bunyip>
<submarine.name.muikku>Muikku</submarine.name.muikku>
<submarine.description.muikku>The workhorse of the colonies, these little shuttles have good speed and dive/ascent characteristics, but they are fragile and their low-capacity batteries limit their range somewhat.</submarine.description.muikku>
<submarine.name.orca>Orca</submarine.name.orca>
<submarine.description.orca>With a relatively high top speed and fantastic ascent and descent characteristics due to her 3 large ballast tanks, Orca class subs are agile vessels, let down only by their small compliment of weapons, unreliable engine and reactors with a greater than average hunger for fuel.</submarine.description.orca>
<submarine.name.remora>Remora</submarine.name.remora>
<submarine.description.remora>A range of customization options are available for Remora. In this model, some of the main hull space has been replaced by a detachable ballast and a remote-controlled drone. A large crew is needed to operate this submarine.</submarine.description.remora>
<submarine.name.typhon>Typhon</submarine.name.typhon>
<submarine.description.typhon>Typhon class subs are known for their brutish appearance, reasonable array of light and heavy firepower, and their general dependability. Any captain should be aware of their poor rate of descent and unimpressive top speed.</submarine.description.typhon>
<submarine.name.dugong>Dugong</submarine.name.dugong>
<submarine.name.dugong_tutorial>Dugong</submarine.name.dugong_tutorial>
<submarine.description.dugong>Compared to larger vessels, the Dugong series is overshadowed in all aspects except one: Their reliability for their price is world class. They're lacking in firepower and speed, so smart maneuvering is key.</submarine.description.dugong>
<submarine.name.selkie>Selkie</submarine.name.selkie>
<submarine.description.selkie>The workhorse of the colonies, these little shuttles have good speed and dive/ascent characteristics, but they are fragile and their low-capacity batteries limit their range somewhat.</submarine.description.selkie>
<submarine.name.venture>Venture</submarine.name.venture>
<submarine.description.venture>Originally intended as research vessels, Venture shuttles have been co-opted as a more robust alternative for travel between outposts and submarines.</submarine.description.venture>
<submarine.name.berilia>Berilia</submarine.name.berilia>
<submarine.description.berilia>Berilia is one of the biggest cargo ships on Europa. Its two engines and three ballasts require a copious amount of power to operate, and keeping the machinery in good working condition is a handful for even a moderately large crew.</submarine.description.berilia>
<submarine.name.kastrull>Kastrull</submarine.name.kastrull>
<submarine.description.kastrull>The Kastrull is a dependable attack sub class bringing plenty of firepower to any fight, and although it's not very nimble, it does sport a drone gunship as standard. Keep in mind that with its experimental open ballast tanks, low tolerance to flooding and numerous crew stations, a large, experienced crew will get the most out of this sub.</submarine.description.kastrull>
<submarine.name.hemulen>Hemulen</submarine.name.hemulen>
<submarine.description.hemulen>For when you need extra room to stretch your legs or want some space between you and the poor, choose Hemulen shuttles.</submarine.description.hemulen>
<submarine.name.typhon2>Typhon 2</submarine.name.typhon2>
<submarine.description.typhon2>Typhon 2 is an overhauled version of the venerable Typhon class of sub. Serving as a heavy gunship, the Typhon 2 class subs remain slow and ugly, but with the benefit of better survivability for their crews.</submarine.description.typhon2>
<submarine.name.azimuth>Azimuth</submarine.name.azimuth>
<submarine.description.azimuth>Superior speed, sleek design and quality-of-life systems make this submarine a favorite among wealthy Coalition captains who manage to make it to retirement.</submarine.description.azimuth>
<submarine.name.r-29>R-29 "Big Rig"</submarine.name.r-29>
<submarine.description.r-29>R-29 is a heavyweight transport ship. While not terribly well armed against Europa's underwater denizens, it has been retrofitted with two powerful electric discharge coils. Original design by rav2n.</submarine.description.r-29>
<submarine.name.barsuk>Barsuk</submarine.name.barsuk>
<submarine.description.barsuk>Barsuk is a favorite among beginner captains. Using materials out of recycled hulls of destroyed submarines (many of which were Barsuks anyway) keeps the price of the line down. Over the years, a subculture of Barsuk-enthusiasts has formed around customizing and tuning their vessels.</submarine.description.barsuk>
<submarine.name.winterhalter>Winterhalter</submarine.name.winterhalter>
<submarine.description.winterhalter>Originally manufactured by Archsteel Yards in New Iapetus, Winterhalter submarines were only in production for a year until they were acquired by the Coalition for research purposes. Many surviving models come equipped with an onboard research laboratory, and they are heavily armed.</submarine.description.winterhalter>
<submarine.name.herja>Herja</submarine.name.herja>
<submarine.description.herja>With its varied weaponry, Herja submarines are equipped for encounters against most expected and unexpected run-ins with the denizens of Europa. A reliable workhorse in the Coalition fleet. If a monster nest has been cleared nearby, chances are high that it was a Herja that did the deed.</submarine.description.herja>
<submarine.name.orca2>Orca 2</submarine.name.orca2>
<submarine.description.orca2>Successor for the classic Orca series, this submarine boasts the same three-ballast setup which allows it to ascend and descend with only a moment's notice. Well armed and equipped for a scout vessel, Orca2 is capable of taking on all but the most dangerous denizens of Europa.</submarine.description.orca2>
<submarine.name.camel>Camel</submarine.name.camel>
<submarine.description.camel>Easily identified by its two humps, the CML (Cargo &amp; Medical Logistics) submarine is best known as the Camel. The Camel has an extensive medic bay and ample cargo space, but it handles flooding poorly. The front ballast tank is a liability, and some less-liked crewmembers may have found an untimely death in an "accident" there. Trivia: The two humps are welded to the submarine during missions, but they can still be detached relatively easily when needed to supply heavier equipment to stations.</submarine.description.camel>

<terminalwelcomemsg.kastrulldiary1>\nDay 1 of the expedition out of Meltwater. We're navigating through a newly discovered gap in the ice, trying to find a shorter route to Novaya Moskva.\n\nIt's not the safest of missions, but hopefully it'll be my last. Should be able to retire after this one.\n\nDay 3. Cap says the whole voyage shouldn't take more than six days. By my reckoning that should place us somewhere around halfway there.\n\nCourse there's always a chance this cave doesn't actually have an exit and we'll have to turn back.\n\nDay 4. Now if I were a superstitious man, I'd wager that saying the worst outcome in any given situation out loud makes it come true. Turns out this route is a dead end.\n\nCaptain is bummed out. I share his disappointment. It'll take a few days longer to get to an outpost now that we have to go back.\n\nDay 8. There was a hole in the ice here. It's gone now. Icebergs must've moved and closed it. We've started broadcasting our position in hopes that someone picks it up. They're joking now, asking me why I chose my last expedition to get lost at sea.\n\nDay 9. We're rationing food and water. Crew is getting ornery.\n\nDay 11? 12? No response. Food's running out. More concerned about water, myself. Don't feel like writing any more.\n\nDay 30-ish, who cares anymore? I'm surrounded by dead men. Pale husks of men slumped on the floor. Some of their eyes still move, but they're dead nonetheless.\n</terminalwelcomemsg.kastrulldiary1>

We're taking heavy hits to our topside!\n[2451-3-4 11:35] Look at the size of that thing!\n[2451-3-4 12:02] We managed to take down the attacker, but the hull is heavily damaged.

<terminalwelcomemsg.traitorletter>This message will be both my farewell and confession. I was tasked to smuggle this sonar beacon on board and turn it on when we were a safe distance away. It turns out it was set to a frequency that attracts monsters. I was promised a shuttle was picking me up when the task was done but they never showed.\n\nThis is the last time I accept a "research assignment" from a big-shoe. Or anyone, for that matter. May they honk in hell.</terminalwelcomemsg.traitorletter>

<!-- Job descriptions -->
<tutorial.mechanictitle>Mechanic - Glue, duct tape and your nerve are the only things keeping the crew alive.</tutorial.mechanictitle>
<tutorial.mechanicdescription>When the plan goes as planned and the gear works is as probable as the human race leaving this shithole. There are no breaks or rest for you, as everything that can break down, will break down. And if nothing’s broken, then it's maintenance, maintenance, maintenance. Getting to the next destination is all that matters, and you’re the one who delivers. There’s no thank-yous or respect, just snickering and contempt from your "fellow crewmembers"—but that’s okay. This is YOUR survival vessel, and if any of them make it too, well...whoop dee doo for them.</tutorial.mechanicdescription>
<tutorial.mechanicresponsibilities>Responsibilities\n-Maintenance of machinery\n-Repairing leaks</tutorial.mechanicresponsibilities>
<tutorial.engineertitle>Engineer - The one who harnesses the power of nature.</tutorial.engineertitle>
<tutorial.engineerdescription>Power and oxygen, it's like that. Without, the ship don’t move and the lungs won’t breathe. Beyond the fancy talk and costume play, you are the guy who really runs the ship, get it? Trust in the laws of physics and think clear. Also, keep your eye on that damn toy-tinkering wannabe engineer mechanic, and whatever you do, don’t bite into the psycho-babble of the medic. He’s so deep in his softie inner world he’s practically a woman. Captain and security are harmless, and way below your intelligence. Obviously.</tutorial.engineerdescription>
<tutorial.engineerresponsibilities>Responsibilities\n-Electrical item maintenance\n-Operating the reactor</tutorial.engineerresponsibilities>
<tutorial.securityofficertitle>Security Officer - The backbone of violence.</tutorial.securityofficertitle>
<tutorial.securityofficerdescription>It is said that pressure brings out the worst in people. Not everybody has your moral strength—hell, most of them are so crooked that it’s questionable if they even should be allowed to live. Channel the crew’s anger toward the creatures outside, but never fool yourself into trusting them. Keep the nukes ready, the handcuffs available, and every now and then put someone in the brig just so they know who’s in charge!</tutorial.securityofficerdescription>
<tutorial.securityofficerresponsibilities>Responsibilities\n-Keeping the order\n-Repelling intruders</tutorial.securityofficerresponsibilities>
<tutorial.medicaldoctortitle>Medical Doctor - Maintaining the key resource: the people</tutorial.medicaldoctortitle>
<tutorial.medicaldoctordescription>Guns and engines and reactors don't keep the ship running—people do. It’s up to you to keep the gunner alive to man the guns and captain alive to steer the ship. And remember, your job goes well beyond the physical. We live crammed into tight spaces, under ice, in the sea. When the lights go out and your "buddies" go to sleep, all kinds of dark shit crawls into their minds. Keep them alive and sane, or put them down like dogs. It’s up to you.</tutorial.medicaldoctordescription>
<tutorial.medicaldoctorresponsibilities>Responsibilities\n-First aid\n-Poisons and antidotes</tutorial.medicaldoctorresponsibilities>
<tutorial.captaintitle>Captain - Naval visionary, seafarer, a genius. Possibly.</tutorial.captaintitle>
<tutorial.captaindescription>Captain Ahab once said, "Hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling." Do you know what that means? No. Does the crew think you are a mysterious genius? Hell yeah. This job is at least as much appearing to know what to do as actually knowing what to do. You are the map and the compass, the guy with the big picture. Navigate and make the tough calls. And remember, you’re just a few steps away from being the mayor of an outpost, and if a couple fellows need to die for that—so be it!</tutorial.captaindescription>

<tutorial.roles.message.1>“Oh hey—how's it floating, dude? You here to get your papers to sign on a submarine?”</tutorial.roles.message.1>
<tutorial.roles.message.1_player>“That's right!”</tutorial.roles.message.1_player>
<tutorial.roles.message.2>“Whoa, such enthusiasm, dude! I love it! Are you familiar with the courses we offer?”</tutorial.roles.message.2>
<tutorial.roles.message.2_player1>“No, what courses?”</tutorial.roles.message.2_player1>
<tutorial.roles.message.2_player2>“Yes.” Skip to tutorial.</tutorial.roles.message.2_player2>
<tutorial.roles.message.3_skip>“All righty dude, just chill in the next room until the other students arrive. Lemme open that door for ya.”</tutorial.roles.message.3_skip>
<tutorial.roles.message.3_skip_player>“Great!”</tutorial.roles.message.3_skip_player>
<tutorial.roles.message.3>“Ah, you know dude, just the thingamajig politician dude in his ivory tower trying to solve a problem...without actually solving the problem, ya know?”</tutorial.roles.message.3>
<tutorial.roles.message.3_player>“What problem?”</tutorial.roles.message.3_player>
<tutorial.roles.message.4>“The submarine business—it ain't all that, you feel me? Ain't many that return from a trip. Ain't any that return from ten trips. So there's a 100% discount on whatever passes as education here, 'cus that'll solve things.”</tutorial.roles.message.4>
<tutorial.roles.message.4_player>“Are you bashing your own program?”</tutorial.roles.message.4_player>
<tutorial.roles.message.5>“I'm just the reception dude, dude. Ain't my job to get meat for the grinder. Want my advice? Take a station job—fight back against the system, dude.”</tutorial.roles.message.5>
<tutorial.roles.message.5_player>“But I want to find adventure! Besides, there's no food here...”</tutorial.roles.message.5_player>
<tutorial.roles.message.6a>“Suit yourself, dude... We offer five courses here:\n\nFirst off, the Captain. If ya feel like delegating all the shitty tasks, this is for you. Highly recommend.”</tutorial.roles.message.6a>
<tutorial.roles.message.6a_player>“Like the famous Herman Pollard!”</tutorial.roles.message.6a_player>
<tutorial.roles.message.6b>“Sure, dude. Then there's the fixin' duo.\nThe Engineer gets all the fancy toys, but with a high risk of bein' shocked. Ain't for the weak hearted.\nThen there's the Mechanic, if ya don't mind getting wet. He's doing the welding and pump-fixing kind of things. Ain't recommended for smokers, feel me?”</tutorial.roles.message.6b>
<tutorial.roles.message.6b_player>“Sounds like important jobs!”</tutorial.roles.message.6b_player>
<tutorial.roles.message.6c>“Yeah, awful right? Then there's the Security Officer, if you like shooting the creepies. They're usually too in love with their power, though. I actually got this tattoo that says ASOAB. Means 'All Security Officers Are Bastards.' Watch out with those dudes, dude.”</tutorial.roles.message.6c>
<tutorial.roles.message.6c_player>“They can't all be that bad?”</tutorial.roles.message.6c_player>
<tutorial.roles.message.6d>“Finally, there's the Medical Doctor. Most of 'em are creepier than the actual creepies, but some actually make people better, man. They're some literal saints, feel me?\nAnyhow, if ya still interested, move on to the next room.”</tutorial.roles.message.6d>
<tutorial.roles.message.6_player>“Sign me up, sir!”</tutorial.roles.message.6_player>

<tutorial.roles.reception_notification>“Hey dude, the teacher is ready for ya.”</tutorial.roles.reception_notification>
<tutorial.roles.reception_notification_player>“On my way.”</tutorial.roles.reception_notification_player>
<tutorial.roles.popup.start>To start the tutorial, find your instructor at the marked location.</tutorial.roles.popup.start>
<tutorial.roles.objective.selection1>Switch character</tutorial.roles.objective.selection1>
<tutorial.roles.objective.selection2>Leave the lounge area</tutorial.roles.objective.selection2>
<tutorial.roles.captaininstructor>“Hi. I am Captain Sterner. I will be your instructor today. I will start with a brief explanation of what it means to be a captain, followed by a practical course. It is crucial to enforce a chain of command, so you will address me as 'Captain.' Say 'Yes, Captain' if you understand.”</tutorial.roles.captaininstructor>
<tutorial.roles.yescaptain_player>“Yes, Captain!”</tutorial.roles.yescaptain_player>
<tutorial.roles.commandroomdescription>“The Command Room is the brains of the submarine. From here signals are passed—either verbally or electronically—to crew and devices.”</tutorial.roles.commandroomdescription>
<tutorial.roles.commandroomdescription2>“Using devices like the navigation terminal and status monitor, the captain can pass all these signals, for example: Order the crew to fix devices, signal the engine to move at full power, or empty the ballast tanks to raise the submarine.”</tutorial.roles.commandroomdescription2>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal>“The core function of the navigation terminal is to move the submarine.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar>“Since we're in a low-light environment, sonar is the most efficient way of identifying terrain, objects and lifeforms.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar2>“Sonar is short for 'sound navigation and ranging.' Sonar has two modes: passive and active.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar2>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar3>“While in 'passive' mode, the sonar only listens to sounds. It will still detect things, especially if these things make a lot of sound. Static objects or terrain, however, won't be detected until very close.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar3>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar4>“While in 'active' mode, the sonar emits pulses of sound at an interval. Simply put, this means every few seconds, the sound wave will reveal terrain, objects and lifeforms. Active sonar is essential to avoid bumping into terrain while moving at any decent speed.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar4>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar5>“Finally, there's the directional ping. While active sonar is great for spotting things, it's also great for being spotted. The directional ping limits the direction of the sound pulse, thus preventing hostiles from spotting your submarine—as long as it's not aimed at them.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar5>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar6>“We've hooked up this navigation terminal to a sonar. Feel free to try it out.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar6>
<tutorial.roles.popup.navigationterminal_sonar>Use [InputType.Select] to interact with the navigation terminal.</tutorial.roles.popup.navigationterminal_sonar>
<tutorial.roles.popup.navigationterminal_sonar2>Try out the sonar functionalities.</tutorial.roles.popup.navigationterminal_sonar2>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering>“Once you have a bearing on your surroundings, it is time to move the submarine.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering2>“Steering is controlled with the display in the middle, which utilizes modern touchcreen and auto-pilot technologies.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering2>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering3>“By default, the auto-pilot will try to maintain the submarine's position. By touching (clicking) the screen, the auto-pilot's target position will change to the indicated position.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering3>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering4>“Furthermore, the auto-pilot has information on outpost locations. It attempts to automatically navigate to predefined positions. This system, however, is neither infallible nor as quick as manual steering.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering4>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering5>“Speaking of manual steering: This is the preferred option for those who want more control over their submarine. By touching (clicking) the screen, you set the submarine's target velocity.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering5>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering6>“For example: If you want your submarine to move slowly to the right, you touch slightly to the right of the submarine's current position. If you want to rise up quickly, you touch far above the submarine's current position.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering6>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering7>“Ready to give it a try?”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering7>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering8>“Trick question! No you're not, cadet! A submarine is usually docked while idle, to prevent it from drifting and using fuel. First, you'll need to undock using the big red "Undock" button. Easy, right? Now, let's try it out.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering8>
<tutorial.roles.popup.navigationterminal_steering>Undock the drone, using the Shuttle Navigation Terminal.</tutorial.roles.popup.navigationterminal_steering>
<tutorial.roles.popup.navigationterminal_steering2>Practice steering the drone. Re-dock the drone when ready.\nTo dock, align the docking hatches (marked in green). Press Dock once the button flashes.</tutorial.roles.popup.navigationterminal_steering2>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding>“Not bad, cadet. You are ready to be a helmsman now, but being a captain is more than that.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding2>“You cannot run a large submarine by yourself. You need a crew. And a crew needs someone to lead them, or they will stumble around like headless chickens. Cluck cluck cluck. Wait, they wouldn't... Never mind.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding2>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding3>“As captain, you're responsible for leading your crew. So you'll have to issue orders to them. Meaning, you'll need to know what needs doing!”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding3>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding4>“That's where the status monitor comes in. With the status monitor, you can see where the submarine is in need of repairs. You can then mark these rooms with tasks and pray there's someone competent enough to perform them. Don't skip the praying part.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding4>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding5>“If you don't want shit to break down in the first place though, you'll have to tell your crew to keep it all in good order. This means issuing them orders from the get-go.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding5>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding6>“Let's try it out on an actual submarine, shall we? The other cadets ought to be ready right about now. Follow me.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding6>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_follow>Follow Captain Sterner into the submarine.</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_follow>
<tutorial.roles.captaininstructor_start>“We're here. Let's start by issuing commands to the crew. Without power, nothing in the submarine will work, so first order the reactor turned on.”</tutorial.roles.captaininstructor_start>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_command>Open the command interface with [InputType.Command].</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_command>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_command2>Order the reactor to be turned on.</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_command2>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_command3>The command interface will automatically select the most qualified crewmember for the assigned task.</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_command3>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_command4>You can also give orders directly to a specific crewmember on the crew list (toggle with [InputType.CrewOrders]).</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_command4>
<tutorial.roles.captaininstructor_repairs>“Great. Remember—captains should command respect and obedience. That's why they usually carry a firearm. Our last engineer, Stevie Dolittle, said, 'What are you going to do, shoot me?' Haha, his cousin didn't stick around long after that. Anyways, let's order some maintenance, shall we?”</tutorial.roles.captaininstructor_repairs>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_commandmaintenance>Order leaks to be fixed.</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_commandmaintenance>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_commandmaintenance2>Order electrical devices to be repaired.</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_commandmaintenance2>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_commandmaintenance3>Order mechanical devices to be repaired.</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_commandmaintenance3>
<tutorial.roles.captaininstructor_firearms>“And no, you won't be given a firearm yet—you'll have to complete your education first. Let's get on with that, shall we? Honkmother knows you'll need it. Speaking of firearms, it's time to get the sub's weapons operational.”</tutorial.roles.captaininstructor_firearms>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_commandsecurity>Order the bottom turret to be operated.</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_commandsecurity>
<tutorial.roles.captaininstructor_end>“That covers the basics. Now the real test: Undock from the station, get us to the next outpost, and you'll be done and graduated! Good luck, cadet!”</tutorial.roles.captaininstructor_end>

<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor>“Welcome! Welcome! I'm Chief Engineer Friar, but please, call me Kayleigh.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor>
<tutorial.roles.reactorroomdescription>“The reactor room is where the heart of the submarine resides. As long as there's electrical juices flowing through the wires, there is life in the submarine. And it—the electricity—all originates from this beauty right here.”</tutorial.roles.reactorroomdescription>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods>“While 'nuclear reactor' may sound scary, because of the whole invisible radiation thing, there's actually nothing to worry about! Operating reactors is relatively safe.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods2>“Relative to the other, waaaay more dangerous dangers, that is. The reactor room is usually quite well protected, and it's centrally located!”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods2>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods3>“One thing to keep in mind, and I will stress this: Do NOT insert every fuel rod you have in your storage into the reactor all at once.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods3>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods4>“Really. Do not. Each fuel rod increases the amount of heat generated by the reactor. Too much heat means a fire will start. Eventually a full-blown meltdown will trigger, and...KABOOM! Well, at least it's a quick death. Sure beats getting captured by pirates.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods4>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods5>“For now, I'm just going to hand you one fuel rod. Let me show you how to insert it.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods5>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods5_player>“Is this really safe?”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods5_player>
<tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_fuelrods>Interact with the reactor, then drag the fuel rod into the slots on the left.</tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_fuelrods>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactor>“A basic start-up of the nuclear reactor looks like this:\n1. One non-empty fuel rod inserted.\n2. Power button pressed.\n3. Automatic control toggled on.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactor>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactor_player>“Sounds simple enough.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactor_player>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactor2>“Give it a try then! Don't be shy!”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactor2>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactor2_player>“On it!”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactor2_player>
<tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_reactor>Interact with the reactor, power it up and enable automatic control.</tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_reactor>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual>“Great job! You're a natural! We now have power. Look at how all the lights are turning on—that was all you!”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual_player>“That was easy enough.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual_player>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual2>“Aha, getting confident, are we? Well, let's switch over to manual control then.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual2>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual3>“In manual control, you're using two controls. The first one, on the left, is the fission rate and the second, on the right, is the turbine output.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual3>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual4>“Increasing the fission rate makes the reactor consume more fuel and generate more heat. The heat is used to spin the turbine, which generates electricity.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual4>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual5>“The higher the turbine output, the more the reactor attempts to generate electricity. If the output is too high relative to the fission rate, the reactor will cool down; too low and it'll overheat.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual5>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual6>“It all boils down to: Keep the left gauge in the green, keep the right gauge in the green.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual6>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual6_player>“Why bother with manual control at all?”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual6_player>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual7>“Great question! Ever been on a submarine and the lights suddenly turned off? That probably meant the reactor was on automatic control and the captain did some sudden maneuvering. Auto is much slower to react to and compensate for higher power needs than manual control is.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual7>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual7_player>“Can I try it?”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual7_player>
<tutorial.roles.engineer_reactormanual>Interact with the reactor, then switch to manual control.</tutorial.roles.engineer_reactormanual>
<tutorial.roles.engineer_reactormanual2>Using the sliders, keep both needles of the gauges in the green areas.</tutorial.roles.engineer_reactormanual2>
<tutorial.roles.engineer_backtoauto>“Good job! Now, let's move on to the next room. But first, turn the automatic control back on. It's important not to leave the reactor on manual when it's unattended!”</tutorial.roles.engineer_backtoauto>
<tutorial.roles.engineer_followme>“All right, I think we're all done with the reactor now! Follow me.”</tutorial.roles.engineer_followme>
<tutorial.roles.electricaldescription>“Welcome to Electrical! Things are buzzing around here, aren't they?! Don't be intimidated by all the wires; they're going exactly where they need to go. I made sure of it.”</tutorial.roles.electricaldescription>
<tutorial.roles.electricaldescription2>“This room is usually filled with junction boxes. All the power from the reactor needs to be distributed, and that's where the jay-bees—or junction boxes—come in!”</tutorial.roles.electricaldescription2>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes>“When junction boxes break down, which they will, any devices connected to them will cease to function. Your job is to keep that from happening!”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes_player>“Why do they break? Can't they, like, not break?”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes_player>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes2>“Good question! Some skilled engineers at outposts can make devices more damage resistant, but let's forget about that for now.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes2>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes3>“Most captains are the rough breakey kind of captains. They prefer to accelerate at maximum power for a few seconds, then completely idle the submarine the next minute for a cigar break. These power fluctuations are what damages the sub's electrical devices most of the time.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes3>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes4>“The other thing is water, of course. Electricity and water don't mix so well, so any time water leaks into the submarine, there will be damage.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes4>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes4_player>“So I just sit here with my screwdriver for the whole trip?”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes4_player>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes5>“Pretty much! Except once you learn how to fast-repair, you'll have a lot of time for other things. Let me show you!”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes5>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes5_player>“Okay.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes5_player>
<tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_junctionboxes>Interact with the junction box and click the repair button in rapid succession.</tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_junctionboxes>
<tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_junctionboxes2>Ouch! Repairing too quickly gets you shocked.</tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_junctionboxes2>
<tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_junctionboxes3>Now try to time clicking the repair button. Click when the moving line hits the colored area of the bar.</tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_junctionboxes3>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring>“That went okay, I think. But look, this one light is still off!”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring_player>“Why's that?”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring_player>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring2>“It's because I removed a wire connecting the junction box to the lamp. But I have it right here—I just need you to connect it.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring2>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring2_player>“How?”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring2_player>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring3>“All you need is a screwdriver in one hand and a wire in the other. Let me show you!”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring3>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring3_player>“Sure.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring3_player>
<tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_wiring>Equip the screwdriver and the wire.</tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_wiring>

<tutorial.airlocktitle>Airlock</tutorial.airlocktitle>
<tutorial.airlockdescription>Every submarine should be equipped with a secure airlock where the crew can exit the sub safely and without too much flooding.\n\nTo safely exit the submarine, equip a diving suit and other necessary items (usually a handheld sonar, weapons and extra oxygen tank or two). Then make your way to the airlock. Be sure to close all the doors behind you to stop the water’s flow before too much of it gets inside.\n\nWhen coming back inside, use water pumps to drain all of the water before going deeper into the submarine. It is also helpful to return all of the equipment back to their proper places and refill used oxygen tanks at the oxygen generator.</tutorial.airlockdescription>
<tutorial.railguntitle>Railgun</tutorial.railguntitle>
<tutorial.railgundescription>The railgun works like a coilgun, except it fires big shells that can be upgraded with explosives.\n\nRailgun loaders are loaded with single railgun shells instead of boxes of ammunition. Otherwise, operating them is the same: Interact with the periscope to aim with the turret, then press {0} to fire. Press {1} to stop aiming.</tutorial.railgundescription>
<tutorial.syringeguntitle>Syringe gun</tutorial.syringeguntitle>
<tutorial.syringegundescription>A ranged weapon of choice for medics, the syringe gun uses medicine as ammunition. This allows for administering cures from afar. Be aware: Medicines fired from long range are less effective than those used in the medical interface.\n\nA tactical choice in combat would be to load the syringe gun with poison and fire it at enemies. Aim the syringe gun the same way you would other long-range weapons: {0} to aim, {1} to fire.</tutorial.syringegundescription>
<tutorial.plasmacuttertitle>Plasma cutter</tutorial.plasmacuttertitle>
<tutorial.plasmacutterdescription>The plasma cutter is a device used to cut through walls and doors. It functions like the welding tool: {0} to aim, {1} to fire.\n\nWhile the plasma cutter is primarily a tool, it does inflict burns on anyone who gets in the way, which makes it a handy makeshift weapon.</tutorial.plasmacutterdescription>
<tutorial.crowbartitle>Crowbar</tutorial.crowbartitle>
<tutorial.crowbardescription>A heavy instrument that can be used to force open doors. Handy when someone has been tampering with door wiring or when you need to get to rooms you’re not allowed in. Use ({0}) the crowbar on a closed door to start prying it open. The crowbar must be equipped to do this.</tutorial.crowbardescription>
<tutorial.mineralstitle>Minerals</tutorial.mineralstitle>
<tutorial.mineralsdescription>The basic materials for crafting can be bought, deconstructed or found in the world.\n\nMinerals are spawned in the cave and ice walls, and they can be cut out using the plasma cutter and then picked up. Raw minerals can be deconstructed to create craftable elements.</tutorial.mineralsdescription>
<tutorial.psychosistitle>Psychosis</tutorial.psychosistitle>
<tutorial.psychosisdescription>When in contact with certain performance-enhancing drugs or under some extraterrestrial influence, players may be afflicted with psychosis, causing them to experience visual and auditory hallucinations and phantom pains.\n\nPsychosis may be cured using haloperidol.</tutorial.psychosisdescription>
<tutorial.opiatestitle>Opiate addiction and withdrawals</tutorial.opiatestitle>
<tutorial.opiatesdescription>Overuse of pain medication causes addiction and, in time, withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms can be reduced by feeding the addiction, but to truly be rid of the effects, one must either stop taking the drugs entirely or use naloxone.</tutorial.opiatesdescription>
<tutorial.oxygentitle>Oxygen</tutorial.oxygentitle>
<tutorial.oxygendescription>Oxygen is a valuable commodity in underwater Europa. It must be readily available during long transits aboard submarines, which is made possible by oxygen generators. They pump air through ventilation to different rooms and can be used to refill oxygen tanks.\n\nTo refill oxygen tanks, interact ([InteractType.Use]) with the generator to open its inventory. Insert an empty oxygen tank into one of the slots to start refilling it. When the tank is full, drag it back to your inventory or into your diving suit/mask.</tutorial.oxygendescription>
<tutorial.laddertitle>Ladders</tutorial.laddertitle>
<tutorial.ladderdescription>To grab onto a ladder, press {0}. Use {1} and {2} buttons to climb the ladder. Let go of the ladder by pressing {3} again.</tutorial.ladderdescription>

<engineer.powerupreactorobjective>Power up submarine’s reactor</engineer.powerupreactorobjective>
<engineer.powerupreactortext>Nuclear reactors provide power to submarines and outposts. They require fuel to create heat and a crewmember to regulate the output.\n\nDrag a fuel rod to the item slot on the left side. Multiple fuel rods create more heat, but in normal circumstances one is enough and any more might cause the reactor to overheat.\n\nStart by setting the fission rate so that the needle is on green, then do the same for turbine output. You can see load and output values to the right. Try to keep the output as close to load as possible; a lower output can lead to power outages, and higher to overvoltage and fires.\n\nWhen the reactor operator leaves the interface, consider turning on automatic control. With automatic control, the reactor responds to any fluctuations in grid load, but it is considerably slower than a human operator.</engineer.powerupreactortext>

<!-- Captain tutorial -->
<captain.docktext>To dock the submarine, maneuver the ship’s and outpost’s docking ports close to each other and toggle the docking clamps. Ports are displayed in green on the sonar display.\n\nWhen the ports are close to each other, a line will be shown on the sonar display. When the line is fully green, close the clamps by pressing the “Dock” button. The submarine will then be locked into position until undocked.\n\nWhen positioning the submarine for docking, radical movements can easily cause you to overshoot your target. Using autopilot and “maintain position” is helpful in setting the position you want the submarine to move to.</captain.docktext>

<!-- Karma system -->
<karma>Karma</karma>
<karmaexplanation>Karma reflects the helpful and harmful actions you've taken while playing. Actions such as repairing the submarine, operating devices and killing monsters increase Karma, while actions such as attacking members of your crew or damaging the submarine decrease it. If your Karma drops too low, you may not get assigned to certain jobs anymore, or, in more extreme cases, you may be banned from the server.</karmaexplanation>

<eventtext.givingdirections.c1>You almost run into someone wearing a captain’s uniform. You can tell by their appearance that they are a visitor here and their time hasn’t been pleasant. They’re studying a map closely and seem deeply concerned about what they see. A revolver hangs loosely from their belt. They mutter a quick apology before returning to the map.</eventtext.givingdirections.c1>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o1>“Hey, can I see that map? What’s the fastest route out of this shithole?”</eventtext.givingdirections.o1>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o1.c1>They scratch the back of their head. “That’s what I’m trying to find out. The problem is that there’s a long way to where we’re going and we’re short on supplies. Can’t exactly afford to go back either.”</eventtext.givingdirections.o1.c1>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1>“Let me take a look. We might be headed in the same direction.”</eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1.c1>Together you manage to find a shortcut to the next outpost. It’s a little on the dangerous side, but what isn’t? You bid the captain farewell.</eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1.o1>A job well done.</eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1.c2>Even with two pairs of eyes, you can’t find an easier route. You leave the captain, hoping their fortune turns soon.</eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1.o2>A shame.</eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o2>“Sucks to be you. Bon voyage!”</eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o2>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o2>Attempt to grab the revolver when their back is turned.</eventtext.givingdirections.o2>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o2.c1>You deftly liberate the gun from its holster and stuff it in your pocket. Your heart skips a beat when the captain turns toward you, but they only give you a quick glance and continue pacing back and forth.

<eventtext.givingdirections.o2.o1>Neat, free gun.</eventtext.givingdirections.o2.o1>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o2.c2>Just as you’re about to lift the gun, the captain suddenly turns around. Your eyes meet and theirs widen as the situation dawns on them. They reach for the gun.</eventtext.givingdirections.o2.c2>

<eventtext.soundinthevent.o1>Unscrew the vent cover to take a better look inside.</eventtext.soundinthevent.o1>
<eventtext.soundinthevent.o1.c1>You manage to get the vent off easily enough and spot the source of the noise right away: The fan blade is brushing against a small metal box. Carefully retrieving it, you open it and find 1,000 marks!</eventtext.soundinthevent.o1.c1>
<eventtext.soundinthevent.o1.c2>You fumble the vent cover as you’re removing it and brush against the spinning blade. It slices into your hand before you can pull away, nicking an artery.</eventtext.soundinthevent.o1.c2>
<eventtext.soundinthevent.o2>Shine your flashlight through the vent slats and see if you can spot anything unusual.</eventtext.soundinthevent.o2>

<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1>Scavenge for parts.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1.c1>You quickly unscrew the parts that look the most useful, carefully place them in your pocket and then put the panel back.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1.o1>Finders keepers.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1.c2>Whoever put this thing together did a poor job. You deem it impossible to salvage anything without taking the whole thing apart. While you’re elbow deep in the wiring, you hear footsteps approach. Panicking, you yank some wires out and slam the panel back in its place.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1.o2>Act natural.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2>Attempt to repair the terminal.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.c1>You jiggle some display cables and the terminal comes back to life. Poking around the system reveals some opportunities. Looks like it’s connected to the outpost’s outfitting service. What do you want to do?</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o1>Request free coilgun ammunition.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o1.c1>After clicking around a bit, you successfully order two boxes of coilgun ammunition for your vessel, free of charge.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o1.o1>This is what they have insurance for, right?</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o2>Install an old-school first-person shooter on the system.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o2>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o2.c1>You carry on the age-old tradition of installing the game on any platform possible. This accomplishes nothing except to give you a good feeling as you chuckle to yourself.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o2.c1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o2.o1>Mission complete.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o2.o1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.c2>You try turning the terminal off and on again. Nothing. Now what? That’s the only thing you were taught to do and it usually solves the problem. Frustrated, you jiggle some wires behind the terminal when you feel a sharp pain shoot up your arm, along with a shower of sparks. You decide that’s enough injury for now.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.c2>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o3>Ouch.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o3>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o3>Back away. There have to be some nerds around here who get paid to fix these things.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o3>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o2>Ignore.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o2>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.c1>Someone has left a toolbelt in the middle of the hallway.</eventtext.clownrelations1.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.c1>The toolbelt contains bike horns, masks and oversized shoes. As you’re rummaging through it, a posse of people dressed in clown suits march down the hallway. One of them walks straight up to the belt, picks it up and stares at you, then at your hand. You realize you’re still holding a bike horn.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o1>Apologize and put the horn back in the toolbelt.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1>Inspect.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.c1>The box contains bike horns, masks and oversized shoes. As you’re rummaging through it, a posse of people dressed in clown suits march down the hallway. One of them walks straight up to the box, picks it up and stares at you, then at your hand. You realize you’re still holding a bike horn in your hand.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o1>Apologize and put the horn back in the box.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o1.c1>The jester turns around stoically and continues on with the group, leaving you to scratch your head.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o2>Honk the horn.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o2.c1>You raise the horn to your eye level and squeeze it. Instantly, chaos erupts among the group of clowns. They applaud, prance around and giggle uncontrollably, as if the sound of the horn were the funniest thing imaginable. One of them ruffles your hair approvingly.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o2>Better not.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o2>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.c1>A clown is loitering nearby. When he sees you approach, he perks up and tries to get your attention.</eventtext.clownrelations2.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.o1>See what he has to say.</eventtext.clownrelations2.o1>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.c1>The jester reaches out to you. In a similar motion, you raise your own arm and simultaneously you both honk each other’s noses. Twice, as is tradition when meeting a new brother. Without saying a word, he reaches into his pack and hands you a brand new bike horn. He salutes you and leaves, his footsteps squeaking rhythmically.</eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.c2>Before you can react, the loathsome harlequin reaches out and painfully honks your nose.</eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.c2>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.o1>Truly, they are a scourge on Europa.</eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.o2>Avoid eye contact.</eventtext.clownrelations2.o2>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.c1>You come across an unconscious worker. There are no signs of violence and nobody else is around.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.c1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1>Diagnose.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.c1>The patient’s lips are blue, their breaths are short and shallow and their heart is beating very slowly. Telltale signs of Fentanyl overdose. Injection marks on their arm confirm your diagnosis.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1>Treat the overdose with Naloxone.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1.c1>You treat the overdose with Naloxone. The patient is still unconscious, but their condition is stable.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1.c2>You have no Naloxone. All you can do at this point is make sure the patient's life is not in immediate danger and alert the local officials.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2>Give them basic first aid and alert the outpost doctor.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2.c1>You make sure the patient is stable and decide to let the local officials deal with the rest.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2.o1>Good job.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.c2>Well, he's unconscious all right. Probably just sleeping off a hangover or something.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.c2>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o3>Eh, that's the best I can do for now.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o3>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o2>Check their pockets.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o2>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o2.c1>You find some spare change in their pocket, but a passerby catches you in the act. It seems looting injured people is frowned upon here.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o2.c1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o3>Step over their body and continue on.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o3>
<eventtext.propaganda.c1>A row of posters line the wall. It looks like the outpost directorial election is coming up. A gallery of stern-looking people are observing the hallway, conveniently grouped according to their political affiliation.</eventtext.propaganda.c1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1>Inspect the posters.</eventtext.propaganda.o1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1.c1>Some of the Coalition Party’s boards have fallen victim to vandalism. “Bring power back to the hands of the people!” and “Down with the oligarchy!” are some of the catchphrases spray-painted on candidates’ faces. Separatists up to their usual tricks.</eventtext.propaganda.o1.c1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1>Add some of your own flair too.</eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1.c1>You draw some vulgar art of your own, then quickly move on before the fascists catch you in the act.</eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1.o1>That'll show them.</eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1.o2>Keep walking.</eventtext.propaganda.o1.o2>
<eventtext.propaganda.o2>Not interested in outpost politics.</eventtext.propaganda.o2>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.c1>As you’re walking down the hallway, you catch a whiff of something sweet.</eventtext.goblincooking1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1>“Who’s cooking?”</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.c1>You sniff around and find the aroma coming from a nearby vent. Suddenly you feel very hungry.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1>Try to find the source.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.c1>You peer into the dark vent, trying to find out where it leads. No avail—the vents here are all connected. Even if you were to, say, climb in and follow the smell, you’d stand no chance of finding the sau–, er…source.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1>“Climb in the vent? Good idea!”</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.c1>It takes you no effort to remove the vent cover and wriggle inside. The smell is now intoxicating and it seems to come from every direction. Desperate, you start crawling. Eventually the vent splits into two paths. Something clicks in your head. This isn’t right.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“I’ve come this far. Might as well keep going.”</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You pick a direction and crawl on. Suddenly it doesn’t smell so good anymore. The aroma has gradually turned into a sickly sweet, rotten stink. You start panicking as the tight walls begin closing in. Your vision blurs and everything goes dark. The last thing you see is a vaguely humanoid shape squirming toward your helpless body.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Goodbye.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>The next thing you know, you wake up outside the vent. Strangely, the vent is screwed shut and there are no signs of anyone having entered it. A quick inspection reveals you're uninjured, but your pockets are empty of change.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2>Turn back.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>With great effort, you manage to turn around and make your way back to where you entered. While unhurt, you have a feeling you brought back something with you from the vents.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1>“At least it's over now.”</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2>“What a fool I would be if I climbed in there…”</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2.c1>You chuckle at the idea of climbing into an air vent in a strange outpost in search of food. Even so, it takes some effort to leave the vent and the alluring aroma within.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2.o1>Now to get back to business.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o2>Ignore the siren call of the scent.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o2>Ignore the aroma.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o2>
<eventtext.outbreak.c1>You overhear someone nearby talking to a radio. “Yeah, I gave them the eggs. Uh huh… Yeah. I made sure they swallowed ‘em. ...I don’t know, maybe three minutes ago?” That’s weird, you think to yourself. Hopefully nothing weird comes out of this.</eventtext.outbreak.c1>
<eventtext.outbreak.o1>OK.</eventtext.outbreak.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.c1>Someone has set up shop in their dorm room. A sign on the door says “Mike the Scryer: He’ll divine answers to all your questions!”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1>Step inside.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.c1>You peek inside. Heavy curtains line the walls that are otherwise full of crudely drawn pictures of monsters, expensive submarines and well-endowed women. In the middle of the room is a round table with a couple of empty bottles of Europan moonshine and a crystal ball. A man wearing thick glasses and a sloppily tied turban is sitting behind the table. He squints and motions you to take a seat. “I’m Mike,” he croaks. “5 marks to ask me anything.”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1>Pay him.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.c1>You sit down at the table opposite Mike. A pungent smell of alcohol wafts from him. “Come on, then. What d’you wanna know about?”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1>“What’s the meaning of life?”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1.c1>Mike conjures up a bottle of booze. “Real original.” He takes a swig. “There are a few schools of thought, but basically it boils down to this: Either you make life good for yourself or do good by others.” He reaches over the table to offer you a drink and knocks down a few bottles in the process. They shatter on the floor. “Shit.” Mike slumps down dejectedly. “There’s no God,” he mutters as he pushes himself up and starts for the cleaning closet. “Session’s over.”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1.o1>All right.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2>“What do you reckon is in the center of Europa?”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2.c1>Mike blinks. “What? I don’t know. Lava? Or is it magma in this case?” He turns toward a bunk. “Hey Jimmy! Is it lava if it’s underground or magma?” A bundle of sheets stirs a bit. “What is–? Fuck off Mike, I’m sleeping,” it mumbles back. Mike scratches the back of his head. “It’s gotta be one or the other. What else could it be?” He chuckles and flashes his rotting teeth. “A gateway to Earth? Ridiculous.”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2.o1>Yeah, I guess it is.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3>“What’s up with the clowns?”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3.c1>“Funny little fuckers, aren’t they?” Mike leans back in his chair. It squeaks in protest. “The legend has it that a cargo ship carrying entertainment supplies wrecked somewhere near Uusi-Turcu. They recovered a single survivor weeks later. She was wearing a striped shirt, rubber mask and gibbering something about a 'Honkmother' who had kept her company.” He picks his nose and pensively inspects his findings. “Ever since, there’s been a group of ‘em what worships the Honkmother.” “Really?” you ask, enthralled. He flicks the booger off. “No. But that’s all I got.”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3.o1>...I want my money back.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o2>Back out.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o2>Ignore all charlatans.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.c1>You run into a familiar face. It seems Mike the fortune teller has found his way here. This time he’s wearing a janitor’s overalls and is in the process of mopping up a puddle of what seems like someone’s former breakfast.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1>“Moving up in the world, eh?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.c1>“Oh, hey. Yeah, I figured it was time to bounce after the... You know, the incident. With the reactor.” You decide not to delve deeper. “I still have plenty of wisdom to dispense. 5 marks or a pack of cigarettes.”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1>Pay up.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.c1>He leans on his mop. “So what can I help you with?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1>“How’s Earth?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1.c1>Mike takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth. “Guess it’s still out there. A bit worse for wear though, am I right?” He flashes a toothless smile and fishes out a lighter from his pocket. “I had a pen pal there a few years back, you know? A real prolific writer. No wonder, you ought to get a lot of writing done with twelve fingers.” He lights the cigarette, takes a drag and coughs his lungs out. “Fuck me!” He exclaims after the fit subsides. “People really smoke these things?” He tosses the whole pack in the trash. “Not for me.”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1.o1>Good to know.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2>“What happened to Mantises?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2.c1>“Oh, them? Natural selection. Some things are just better suited for survival.” He rolls up his sleeve, revealing a crude tattoo that states: “I fuck with boots on.” He continues: “Tougher. Faster. Prettier. Only the strong come out on top.” A passerby tosses a soda can on the floor and Mike bends to pick it up. “Apex predators, that’s what we are,” he declares as he places the can in the trash.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2.o1>Truth.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3>“Why would someone shoot a man before throwing him out of an airlock?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3.c1>“It’s all part of the plan,” Mike muses. “Sending a message. You gotta assert dominance, otherwise you get no respect.” He gets back to mopping the puke off of the floor. “It’s how you survive on a submarine, same as in prison.” “You were incarcerated?” you ask. “Oh, I’ve been all around. I tell you, the things you have to do to get respect... I still have trouble walking straight.”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3.o1>That's too much info.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o2>Act like someone’s calling you on the radio.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o2>Sneak by.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot.nomoney>“Mike knows many things, and he'll tell you some. But only if you have the coin.”</eventtext.miketheidiot.nomoney>
<eventtext.firefighting.c1>You notice a thin trail of smoke rising from a trash can.</eventtext.firefighting.c1>
<eventtext.firefighting.o1>Investigate.</eventtext.firefighting.o1>
<eventtext.firefighting.o1.c1>There is a lit cigarette in the trash. It seems dangerously close to igniting a larger flame.</eventtext.firefighting.o1.c1>
<eventtext.firefighting.o1.o1>Put it out.</eventtext.firefighting.o1.o1>
<eventtext.firefighting.o1.o1.c1>You get some minor burns when you fish the cigarette out and stomp out the fledgling fire, but nothing major.</eventtext.firefighting.o1.o1.c1>

<eventtext.firefighting.o2>Not my problem.</eventtext.firefighting.o2>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.c1>Some workers are huddled together, playing a game with dice. They have piled various items together, presumably as prizes for the winner. Among them is a shiny, symmetrical item. You recognize it as alien, and probably worth more than the other items combined.</eventtext.sleightofhand.c1>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o1>Join the game and attempt to win the item for yourself.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o1>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o1.c1>You quickly deduce that it’s a game of pure luck. You take a few careful risks and it pays off. You walk away with the prized alien ornament.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o1.c1>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o1.c2>Unsurprisingly, the other players are more experienced in the game than you. After betting a sizeable amount of cash, you walk away with nothing. You have lost 500 marks.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o1.c2>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o2>Create a distraction and try to snatch it without anyone noticing.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o2>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o2.c1>You start yelling “Fire! Fire!” and quickly grab the item in the ensuing chaos. You hide it deep in your pocket. It’s time to go before they’re any wiser.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o2.c1>

<eventtext.foreshadowing.o1>Read it.</eventtext.foreshadowing.o1>
<eventtext.foreshadowing.o1.c1>It states: “The truth is out there. cbspusbvnbhbnf.dpn/efsfmjdu/beweht.htm”</eventtext.foreshadowing.o1.c1>

<eventtext.separatistrelations.o2>Help them.</eventtext.separatistrelations.o2>
<eventtext.separatistrelations.o2.c1>You act as a lookout for the two activists. When they finish their masterpiece, you exchange a few words. They deem you loyal to their cause and promise to put a good word in for you.</eventtext.separatistrelations.o2.c1>

<eventtext.huskcultrelations.c1>Someone is handing out flyers advertising some kind of a communion. You spot a familiar-looking logo in the corner. It’s just the local husk cult members proselytizing. It might be fun to check out the ritual.</eventtext.huskcultrelations.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1>Sure, what’s the worst that could happen?</eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1>
<eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1.c1>You make your way into the advertised dorm. It’s the usual stuff: “Fleshbags” this and “ascension” that. The local chapter guys are very friendly and they invite you to partake of the communion.</eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1.c1>

<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.c1>You there, you look halfway competent. Give me a hand with this engine.</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.c1>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o1>Refuse.</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o1>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o1.c1>You decline as tactfully as you can but he’s clearly not happy. He shakes his head and silently goes back to work, trying to refit the engine.</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2>Help him with his engine.</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2.c1>You roll up your sleeves and get to work refitting the engine with him. After a few minutes of work you both manage to get it running. “Thanks. I’m sure I’d have got it going on my own eventually but you’ve saved me some time. Let me know if you want any work done on your sub and I’ll see about giving you a little discount for your trouble.”</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2.c2>You roll up your sleeves and get to work refitting the engine with him. In spite of your best efforts though, the engine refuses to start. He slams shut the access panel. “Well I guess this is one for the scrappers. Thanks for the help anyhow.”</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2.c2>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.c2>He clearly doesn’t care much for what he sees and returns to his work. Apparently you’ve somehow not passed muster.</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.c2>
<eventtext.mediator.c1>Two workers are arguing loudly. What once might have been a civil discussion about inter-Europan politics has devolved into a shouting match—it isn’t readily apparent how the other guy’s mother factors into it.</eventtext.mediator.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1>Try to calm the situation down.</eventtext.mediator.o1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.c1>You move a bit closer. For a moment, the two loudmouths stop arguing and look at you.</eventtext.mediator.o1.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o1>“Hey fellas. Not my place to interrupt, but they can hear your conversation back in Versas.”</eventtext.mediator.o1.o1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o1.c1>The two workers are humbled by your parental demeanor. They quiet down and get back to their duties.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o1.c2>They are even more pissed off now, but this time at you. Your condescending manner of speaking does you no favors.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2>“I suggest you two shut your traps before I finish counting to three. One…”</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.c1>They get the feeling you have the means to back up your words. The two workers go quiet in a record time.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.c2>They look at you bemusedly.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.c2>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1>Two...</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.c1>They look at each other. Clearly, they’re shaking in their boots.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.o1>Three.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.o1.c1>A smile appears on the other’s face and you smile at him in turn. You feel powerful. Your smile quickly turns into a frown when they grab their tools and walk toward you with ill intent.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o2>Egg them on.</eventtext.mediator.o2>
<eventtext.mediator.o2.c1>You don’t know exactly what’s going on, but join in the shouting anyway. “Remember what he said about your mom?” “That shit doesn’t fly where I’m from!” You feel giddy as the shouting crescendos into a fistfight and the two workers start reaching for their tools. It might be a good time to vanish from the area.</eventtext.mediator.o2.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o3>Nothing to see here. Keep walking.</eventtext.mediator.o3>
<eventtext.blackmarket.c1>“Hey! Got something for ya here if you’re interested…”</eventtext.blackmarket.c1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1>Listen to what they have to say.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1>“I happened to find some nice alien contraband. It’s yours for 1,000 marks. I’ll throw in a power cell too. What do you say?” He opens his coat to reveal a pistol that looks like genuine alien tech.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.c1>Do you want to buy the pistol for 1,000 marks?</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1>Yes, please.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1.c1>He hands you the pistol. It’s a genuine article.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1.c2>He shoves the pistol in your hand and quickly shuffles off. On a closer look, the pistol is actually a children’s toy. You angrily toss it aside.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o2>No thanks.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2>“I found some weird eggs in the vents. Dunno what they are but figured they’d mean something for someone like you.” He flashes some eggs but it’s too dark to make out which species. He quickly hides them before you can ascertain their nature. “500 marks.”</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.c2>Do you want to buy the eggs for 500 marks?</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.c2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1>Yes, please.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1.c1>He carefully places the eggs in your hand. Most of them are actually oversized marbles, but one is a genuine mudraptor egg. “This can potentially cause a lot of damage,” you think to yourself as you stow it safely inside your jacket.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1.c2>In the light, the eggs are instantly recognizable as “Velonaceps calyx,” otherwise known as husk eggs.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1.c2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o2>No thanks.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o2>Ignore.</eventtext.blackmarket.o2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.nomoney>“Not enough cash? I thought the submarine business paid well...”</eventtext.blackmarket.nomoney>
<eventtext.huskcultist.c1>“Hello, fellow traveler!” a pale figure greets you. You’re slightly taken aback by their cheerfulness. “Would you happen to have any eggs of the species Velonaceps calyx? I’ll pay good money for each one you come across in your travels.” Their facade momentarily slips and you can hear them muttering under their breath. You can make out “disgusting meatsack” and something about “ascending.”</eventtext.huskcultist.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1>Check your pockets for eggs.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.c1>You check your pockets. As luck would have it, you have some husk eggs on you.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o1>Sell the eggs for 1,000 marks.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o1.c1>You exchange the eggs for money, which you count immediately. It's all there.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o2>Give the eggs for free.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o2>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o2.c1>You decide to donate the eggs for free. The person seems overjoyed.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o3>Actually, I'll keep these for now.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o3>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.c2>You check your pockets. You're fresh out of husk eggs.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.c2>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o4>“I don't have the eggs on me but I'll go get some.”</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o4>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o4.c1>“I'll be here,” the person whispers. It sends shivers down your spine.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o4.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o5>“Sorry, don't have any.”</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o5>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o2>Uhh...probably best to keep moving.</eventtext.huskcultist.o2>
<eventtext.fanclub.c1>A crowd of teens has gathered to observe the newcomers to their outpost. They’re loudly arguing about which is the coolest job on board a submarine.</eventtext.fanclub.c1>
<eventtext.fanclub.o1>Talk to them.</eventtext.fanclub.o1>
<eventtext.fanclub.o1.c1>They have an endless amount of questions. You answer them diligently, and in the end you have the feeling a few of them are going to grow up to be seafarers. Remember: If they wind up as crawler food, it’ll be blood on your hands.</eventtext.fanclub.o1.c1>
<eventtext.fanclub.o2>Ignore them.</eventtext.fanclub.o2>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.c1>Two pale characters with bags under their eyes approach. They’re reaching for something under their clothes. You feel threatened.</eventtext.huskcultambush.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.o1>“Hey, fellas. What’s—uh... What’s this?”</eventtext.huskcultambush.o1>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.o1.c1>The two figures draw out sharp knives and lunge at you.</eventtext.huskcultambush.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.o2>“Easy, dear brothers. My time for ascension isn’t here yet.”</eventtext.huskcultambush.o2>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.o2.c1>They stop their approach, apologize for the confusion and the three of you grab some crawler cocktails and laugh it off. They share information on this outpost.</eventtext.huskcultambush.o2.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.o2.c2>The two figures draw out sharp knives and lunge at you.</eventtext.huskcultambush.o2.c2>
<eventtext.missionevent_cargo_campaignstart.c1>“We've sold some basic construction materials to the neighbouring outpost, but delivery is on us. A simple transport job; perfect for a new crew like yourselves. What say you?”</eventtext.missionevent_cargo_campaignstart.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_cargo1.c1>“We hired a crew to transport these materials, but they never showed. The stuff is still here if you want the job.”</eventtext.missionevent_cargo1.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_cargo2.c1>“Got some real 'handle with care' cargo sitting in the bay. Normally I wouldn't trust them with any new face but I hear you've proved yourselves.”</eventtext.missionevent_cargo2.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_cargo3.c1>“These research materials are sorely needed in the neighboring outpost. It's imperative they get to their destination intact.”</eventtext.missionevent_cargo3.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_killswarm.c1>“No transport ship can leave without running into a swarm of monsters. Take care of the problem and there's a reward in it for you.”</eventtext.missionevent_killswarm.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_killmonstercommon.c1>“There's this especially mean monster terrorizing the caves near here. I've put a little reward aside for the crew that takes it down.”</eventtext.missionevent_killmonstercommon.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_killmonsterrare.c1>“I've heard reports of a gargantuan monster somewhere in the vicinity. If you want to try hunting it down, be my guest. Just make sure you're prepared. It's a dangerous one.”</eventtext.missionevent_killmonsterrare.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_salvageartifact.c1>“We picked up a signal nearby. The eggheads say it could be something alien. If you check it out, there'd be some marks in it for you.”</eventtext.missionevent_salvageartifact.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_salvagewreck.c1>“We received a distress signal from a vessel that was carrying some sensitive cargo. The contents are probably long gone by now but the captain's logbook should shed some light on what happened to it. I want you to recover it.”</eventtext.missionevent_salvagewreck.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_killmonster.c1>“I posted about an assignment earlier. Sent the details to your onboard navigation system too, in case you're interested.”</eventtext.missionevent_killmonster.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_cargo.c1>“I posted about an assignment earlier. Sent the details to your onboard navigation system too, in case you're interested.”</eventtext.missionevent_cargo.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_salvage.c1>“I posted about an assignment earlier. Sent the details to your onboard navigation system too, in case you're interested.”</eventtext.missionevent_salvage.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.c1>There are flyers with notices for various jobs. One of them is for ferrying a few boxes of clowning equipment to a neighboring outpost. It states: “If interested, imitate your favorite bird.”</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o1>“Krruu!”</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o1>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o1.c1>A distant sound of a bike horn confirms you as the recipient of the assignment. A container is waiting for you when you leave the outpost.</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o1.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o2>“Caw! Caw!”</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o2>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o2.c1>A distant sound of a bike horn confirms you as the recipient of the assignment. A container is waiting for you when you leave the outpost.</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o2.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o3>Stay silent.</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o3>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1>An announcement comes over the PA. “Calling the crew of the vessel that just docked. Please send a representative to see the security chief in administration.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1>“You're one of the new arrivals? Good. I have a sensitive issue I can't trust any of my own employees with.” The chief pauses for a second, sizing you up, then continues. “In usual circumstances, I wouldn't ask for help from just anyone, but I'm running out of options. Needless to say, I need you to keep this to yourself. Are you interested?”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1>“Tell me more.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.c1>The chief nods. “According to intel we managed to gather earlier, we can expect a separatist prison break soon,” they state, matter-of-factly. “Prison breaks are already a nasty business, but to complicate matters I have reason to believe they have a man on the inside.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1>“Pun intended?”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.c1>“I'm talking about inside the security force.” It seems like sense of humor isn't how one makes it to chief of security. “To cut to the chase, I need to make sure all my personnel are on the level and take precautions. Here's what I want you to do. Take these microphones and hide them in the crew quarters.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o1>Accept the mission.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You pick up some small surveillance microphones. “One more thing. I can't permit this kind of surveillance in an official capacity. If you get caught, you're on your own.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o2>“I'd rather not get involved.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o2>“I'd rather not get involved.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.c1>These must be the quarters the chief was talking about.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1>Hide microphones under the bunks.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c1>You quickly stuff the mics in footlockers under the bunks. The sound coming through is a bit muffled but serviceable. Return to the chief to receive your payment.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c1.c1>“Good work. Here's your payment. We never spoke.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c2>You toss the mics under a bunk. When you turn around to leave, you run into a security guard. “What are you up to?” they ask.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1>“Oh, just some calisthenics. Need to stay in shape for emergencies.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c1>The guard seems satisfied with the explanation and goes back to their rounds. Return to the chief to receive your payment.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c1.c1>“Good work. Here's your payment. We never spoke.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c2>“You look like you've never done an honest day's work in your life.” They start inspecting undersides of the bunks. Now would be a good time to vanish before they get any wiser. This mission is a failure.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c2.c2>The guard draws their weapon. “Microphones, huh? You need to come with me.” Now would be a REALLY good time to run.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c2.c2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2>“Just installing some surveillance mics.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2.c1>The guard lets out a brief chuckle. “A funny guy. You shouldn't be here. Go on, git.” The guard then turns their attention to the cameras.

<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2.c1.c1>The guard draws their weapon. “Microphones, huh? You need to come with me.” Now would be a REALLY good time to run.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2>Hide microphones inside some electronics.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c1>You open up a nearby transistor radio and install a microphone inside the speaker, out of sight. Return to the chief to receive your payment.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c1.c1>“Good work. Here's your payment. We never spoke.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c2>You spot a transistor radio that could possibly hold a microphone. As you're fiddling with it, a security guard calls out. “You! Come here!” You decide to comply for now. “What were you doing?” the guard demands.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1>“Fixing the radio antenna.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1.c1>“Finally. Make sure K-Rawler comes through loud and clear.” Something will come through all right, you think to yourself. Return to the chief to receive your payment.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1.c1.c1>“Good work. Here's your payment. We never spoke.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1.c1.c1>

<eventtext.tastetest.c1>In a nearby trash can, there are two small bottles of clear liquid. Both of them are labeled with a different chemical formula.</eventtext.tastetest.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1>Take a closer look at the bottles.</eventtext.tastetest.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.c1>Neither solution is anything you’re especially familiar with, but you are reasonably sure one of them is strongly acidic. You decide to leave the acid be. The other bottle is a total mystery to you.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1>Bottoms up!</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.c1>The solution has a slightly mellow and sweet quality to it and it leaves a lingering aftertaste of apricot. It seems to have no other effects. You decide to leave the bottles in the trash and continue on.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1>Not bad.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.c1>After a while, you realize drinking the solution has made all your pains disappear. For the first time in forever, you feel good. You don't know what the solution is but you wish you had some more. Maybe there's some more in the trash?</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.o1>Maybe I should take another look in there.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You return to the trash can and find a couple more bottles. None of them are the same as the one you drank but maybe they can be of some other use.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o2>Not a very sensible thing to do...</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o2>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.c2>Chemistry makes no sense to you; it might as well be an alien language. After a quick shake test, either liquid seems perfectly safe to you. One of them has a blue label, the other green. Do you want to try one of them?</eventtext.tastetest.o1.c2>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3>Blue label.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.c1>The solution has a slightly mellow and sweet quality to it and it leaves a lingering aftertaste of apricot. It seems to have no other effects. You decide to leave the bottles in the trash and continue on.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.o1>Not bad.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.o1.c1>After a while, you realize drinking the solution has made all your pains disappear. For the first time in forever, you feel good.

<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.o1.o1.c1>You return to the trash can and find a couple more bottles. Maybe one of these is the same miracle solution!</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4>Green label.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4.c1>The liquid burns your throat a bit when you swallow it. At first, the effect isn’t unlike a good Jovian vodka, and the prospect of getting buzzed while spending no money appeals to you greatly. The situation suddenly takes a turn for the worse when you feel like your stomach is on fire. A sharp pain causes you to double over in agony. Who would’ve thought drinking something out of the trash was a bad idea?</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4.o1>Not good.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o5>No, of course not!</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o5>

<eventtext.crawleroutbreak.c1>A panicked researcher runs past you. “God dammit Jimmy, I told you we should’ve went with padlocks instead of these electronic pieces of shit!”</eventtext.crawleroutbreak.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.c1>As you step inside the office, the manager notices you. “I suppose you're here about the situation in the mines?” he asks.</eventtext.consultant.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1>“Uh...sure. Remind me what the situation was, again?”</eventtext.consultant.o1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.c1>It turns out the miners have halted the work in the mines because of a toxic gas leak. “They're demanding ridiculous hazard pay and we just don't have the budget for that. That's why you're here, right? To negotiate a better deal?”</eventtext.consultant.o1.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1>“Yes, that's right. Get me in contact with the foreman.”</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1>“They can probably be found near the main mineshaft. Good luck.”</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.c1>The foreman is pacing back and forth, loudly arguing with someone on the radio. You only catch the tail end of their discussion. “There aren't enough diving masks for the whole crew. Even if there were, we couldn't waste the oxygen keeping them on all day long. ...No, the ventilation in the mines is connected to the rest of the outpost so we can't risk pumping it out either.” Exasperated, he looks at you. “Are you here about the gas leaks?”</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1>Haggle for lower hazard pay for miners.</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>You successfully explain that not everyone can be paid extra for hazardous work. This will probably result in most of the crew walking out and the rest having to work their asses off, but at least you got paid a hefty consultant fee.</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1.c2>The foreman stands their ground. No hazard pay, no digging. At least you tried.</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1.c2>

<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2.c1>“Mercury gases. Colorless, odorless, gives you breathing problems real quick.”</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1>Come up with a solution to help with mercury exposure.</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c1>“A combination of iron, Stabilozine and crawler liver should keep your lungs clean of mercury.

<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o3.c1>“The ducts reach from here all the way to the mess hall and dorms, meaning we can't pump the vapors out. I don't know who installed them originally, but I'd like to have a word with 'em.”</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o3.c1>

<eventtext.huskcultist_return.o1>Yes.</eventtext.huskcultist_return.o1>

<eventtext.unlockpatheuropanridge.c2>“Looking to pass through to the Plateau? I don't know... I haven't seen much effort from your side to prove your loyalty to the cause. A donation would go a long way.”</eventtext.unlockpatheuropanridge.c2>

<eventtext.stowaway1.c1>Hmm. This box wasn't here before.</eventtext.stowaway1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1>Investigate.</eventtext.stowaway1.o1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1.c1>It is a regular storage crate found all over Europa, identical to the ones you receive your supplies in. You bend down and try to open it. However, as you start lifting the lid, something slams it back down.</eventtext.stowaway1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1>“Hello?”</eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.c1>No response.</eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1>Listen closely.</eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You hold your breath and put your ear next to the crate. You can hear rustling from inside.</eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Forcefully remove the lid.</eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You successfully wrestle the lid off. To your surprise, a small crawler jumps out ready to claw your eyes out!</eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c2>You successfully wrestle the lid off. Lying on top of a saline shipment is a small creature. It eyes you carefully, then crawls out of the crate and looks at you expectantly. It seems like you have made a friend.</eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.stowaway2.c1>Noises are coming out of this cabinet. As you approach it, they grow quiet.</eventtext.stowaway2.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1>Investigate.</eventtext.stowaway2.o1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.c1>When you open the cabinet door, a harlequin in unusual garb steps out. They greet you formally and explain that they are a messenger.</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o1>“What is your message?”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o1.c1>The jester explains that there is a sunken submarine nearby. It was carrying an item of tremendous value to the Honkmother. The messenger doesn't wait for your answer. Instead, they turn on their heels and leave you to ponder.</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.c2>You carefully open the cabinet door, only to reveal a mouth-agape, wide-eyed young person hiding in it. By the looks of them, they are in their late teens.</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.c2>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2>“Who are you?”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.c1>“N-nobody special, I guess,” the teen stammers.</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1>“What are you doing in there?”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.c1>“Me and a couple of friends snuck on board while you were visiting [location].

I swear I didn't mean to stay here for this long.”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1>“What am I going to do with you?”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.c1>“W-well, I'd like to go back home. If you don't want to go back, I guess I can hop onto a shuttle on the next station.”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o1>“I'm taking you back home.”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o1.c1>The teen climbs out of the cabinet. “Thanks. I'll stay out of trouble, I promise.”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o2>“You'll get off at the next stop.”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o3>“Come out. You're working for me now.”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o3>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o3.c1>“Are you serious?” the teen whines. Yes, you are. That'll teach them to sneak on board strange vessels.</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o3.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o2>“Stay there. I'll be back later.”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o2>
<eventtext.shockjock.c1>A radio is blaring nearby. A man with a raspy voice is yelling about something.</eventtext.shockjock.c1>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1>Listen.</eventtext.shockjock.o1>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.c1>“Well we've all heard about this nonsense about so-called clown brutality. As if for some reason clowns are being sought out and roughed up because of how they look. Let me tell you, it's got nothing to do with the color of their makeup and everything to do with how they choose to carry themselves!”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.c1>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.o1.c1>In fact, in this latest incident, I can only imagine how it would have unfolded if the jester in question had been wearing a suit and a tie instead of oversized shoes and a ridiculous wig! And instead of running away, they could've gone 'Yes, sir,' 'No, sir,' and they'd be on their merry way right now! But no. The take-away here, dear listeners, is: Clown around and your brains will end up all over the walls.”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.shockjock.signoff>“And that's all the time we have for now. Remember, listen and obey. Maurice! Hold the cards up! Maur— No! What does that even mean?” The person in the booth sounds very irate. “Maurice, I swear to— What do I even pay you for?” The broadcast suddenly stops and is replaced by static.</eventtext.shockjock.signoff>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.c2>“Recreational drug use is on the rise, people. Have you heard about “Cult of the Husk”? A bunch of weirdos abusing biohazardous materials? And the establishment does nothing about it!”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.c2>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.o2.c1>“And don't get me started on casual opioid use that's rampant everywhere! According to trusted sources, the Coalition is putting something in them, making them addicting! Before too long, it'll be your children, squatting away in abandoned outposts, wearing dirty robes, doing whatever substances they can get their grubby hands on.”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.c3>“Dear listeners, if I was the Coalition president, I would walk right into the crew quarters, set up my little podium and say, 'Listen, citizens, if you vote against military spending and a separatist army marches in and blows you up, we're not going to do anything about it.'”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.c3>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.o3.c1>“You want to cry about your ruined little station? Give us your money next time! Anyway, that's what I would say, if I was the president.”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.o3.c1>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.c4>“What a bunch of bullshit. Don't believe everything you hear on the radio.”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.c4>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.o4>“What was that broadcast about?”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.o4>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.o4.c1>“It's some weird hermit who's built a makeshift radio station somewhere. Nobody knows where, otherwise somebody would have put a stop to it already. The guy gets on everybody's nerves.”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.o4.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra1.c1>(Hmm? What's this?)</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra1.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra1.o1>Take a look at the ID card.</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra1.o1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra1.o1.c1>(The ID card belongs to one Jacov Subra. Where have I heard that name before? Oh well.)</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra1.o2>Ignore the card.</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra1.o2>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.c1>A worker, presumably on break, is reading the paper. “Hey, you hear about that Subra guy?”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1>“No, who's that?”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.c1>“Jacov Subra. He's a weird guy who put together these—how should I put it—'themed' festivals.” The person rolls their eyes. “Full of husks. Multiple fatalities. He had a high profile trial a while back. You might have read about it on the Europan. Anyway.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.c1>“They caught him here a week ago. From what I heard, he had held another disastrous festival nearby, and was sent to the mines.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.o1>“That's good news.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Good news, until he slipped away again.” A tone signals that the break is over. The worker puts the paper away and starts toward the dock. “I hear they put up a reward for whoever brings him to custody,” they yell over their shoulder.</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o2>“What's he done now?”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o2>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o3>“Don't address me, trash.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o3>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra3.c1>“Welcome to the annual 'Church of the Mollusc' festival! Featuring: Sonata Aquatica, Jethro Hull, Irma-Donna, Draft Bunk and many more! With a special appearance by Sacov Jubra!” The word “mollusc” is written on top of a scribbled out “husk.” Seems like the festival is being held nearby. A passerby exclaims: “Draft Bunk is playing! Sweet!”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra3.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra3.o1>Interesting.</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra3.o1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.c1>“You'll never take me alive!”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1>“Give up, Jacov! You're coming with me!”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.c1>“I'm not going anywhere! I'm innocent! Look, I'll pay you!”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1>“Save it for the judge.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.c1>“Been there, done that.” Jacov smiles devilishly. “What makes you think I won't run away again?”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o1>“Not my problem.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o1.c1>“I can see your heart isn't in this. I'll give you three thousand marks and you let me walk out of here. Deal?”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.deal>“Deal.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.deal>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.neversaw>“Here's the money. We never saw each other.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.neversaw>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.nodeal>“No deal. Come along now, quietly.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.nodeal>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.run>As soon as the words leave your lips, Jacov hurls a fistful of coins at your head and turns to run away.</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.run>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2>“Maybe I'll put a bullet in your leg.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.c1>Jacov is sweating profusely. “Surely you wouldn't shoot an unarmed man?”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.o1>“Absolutely I would.” (Attack)</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.o1>

<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.o2.c1>Fine, I'll come quietly.</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.o2.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o2>“How much?”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o2>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o2.c1>“Three thousand for you and we part as friends, right here.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o2>“Wasn't trying to. (Attack)”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o2>
<eventtext.infiltration.c1>The station manager looks at you with haggard eyes. “You're one of the new arrivals? Man, am I glad to see a non-masked face.”</eventtext.infiltration.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1>“Now that you mention it, there are a lot of masks around.”</eventtext.infiltration.o1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.c1>“A bunch of clowns. Let me ask you, you ever wake up in the middle of the night to a sound of bike horns? They don't even attempt any kind of melody, just honking away all willy-nilly. I haven't had a full night's sleep in...days?” They stare blankly into space. “Weeks?”</eventtext.infiltration.o1.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1>“Sounds horrible. What do they want?”</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.c1>“Who knows? I've tried talking to them, offering money, threatening to kick them out, you name it, I've tried it. I think they're content with torturing me and the rest of the crew.”</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1>Offer to help.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.c1>“The manager scoffs. “Tell you what. You get them to leave, there's a...” Their eyes narrow as they study you. “Thousand marks for you. One more thing. No physical violence. While I personally wouldn't shed any tears for roughed up clowns, we have rules here we adhere to.”</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o1>“Not even a little?”</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“No.”</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2>“Got it.”</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>You approach a clown. They stare at you.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1>Threaten the clown.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.c1>You stare the clown down for a minute. They try to grab your nose but you slap their arm away. You point to the direction of the airlock. With slumped shoulders, the clown shuffles away, their friends in tow.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o1>Mission complete.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o1.c1>It's suddenly very quiet. You report your success to the manager on the radio and one thousand marks are deposited to your account.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.c2>You strain to flex your biceps. For some reason this only succeeds in making the clown laugh in your face and continue their merriments.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.c2>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o2>Mission failed.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o2>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o2.c1>You have missed your chance at making an impactful impression and dejectedly report failure to the station manager.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o2>Build rapport.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o2>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o2.c1>You try to reason with the clowns, explaining that their behaviour is disrupting the lives of the crew here and frankly, quite unacceptable. Your words fall to deaf ears.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o2.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o2>“Well, good luck with that.”</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.infiltration.o2>“Don't speak to me, you harlequin-hater.”</eventtext.infiltration.o2>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.c1>A sound of shattering glass makes you jump. Someone is slouched against the wall, shards of glass at her feet. By the looks of it, it might have been a bottle of rum she was holding. She's muttering under her breath.</eventtext.badvibrations1.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.o1>“You okay?”</eventtext.badvibrations1.o1>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.c1>No response. You notice she's repeating the same thing over and over. “Bad vibrations, man. Bad vibes.” Drool is slowly dripping from the corner of her mouth onto her jacket.</eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.o1>Try to help her.</eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.o1.c1>You're wondering about the person's mental health, when they unexpectedly swing around and grab you by the collar. “Bad vibrations, do you hear me?” A sudden realization dawns on her when she recognizes you as a member of a submarine crew. “You can help me,” she pleads. “We found a relic. Turned it on. In the structure. Deep.” She lets up her grasp on you for a second.</eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.o1.o1>“You're making no sense.”</eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.o1.o1.c1>The madness seems to have found it's way back to cloud her mind. “I was first! I know! I got the trophy!”</eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.stepback>Take a step back.</eventtext.badvibrations1.stepback>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.raving>You wonder what the person is raving about. A relic inside a structure? Something in the ruins? You make a note to check it out if you have time.</eventtext.badvibrations1.raving>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.notmyproblem>Not my problem.</eventtext.badvibrations1.notmyproblem>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.c1>Touching the artifact's etched surface causes an almost imperceptible itch inside your head.</eventtext.badvibrations2.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.o1>Drop the artifact.</eventtext.badvibrations2.o1>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.c1>For some reason, you find it very difficult to drop the item, and it remains in your hands. The itch builds up into a slight vibrating feeling in your skull.</eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.o1>Throw away the artifact.</eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.o1.c1>It's as if you've forgotten how to move your arms. Your head feels uncomfortably warm and numb. It's getting more and more challenging to keep your focus on anything.</eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.o1.o1>Sleep.</eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.o1.o1.c1>You close your eyes. This seems like as good a place as any to have a nap. Jupiter knows you've earned one. You let yourself fall back into a dreamless sleep.</eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.inspect>Inspect the artifact more closely.</eventtext.badvibrations2.inspect>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.protrusion>As you run your hands across the item's surface, you hit a protrusion. At once, the numbness inside subsides and you are again fully aware of your surroundings. Time to get this artifact somewhere it can be kept safe.</eventtext.badvibrations2.protrusion>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.c1>Somebody is trying to get your attention. “Hey! I've been looking for you.” She looks vaguely familiar. “You don't remember me, do you?”</eventtext.badvibrations3.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.o1>“Oh yeah, you're the one with the, uh, vibrations.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.o1>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.gotbetter>“So, I got better. Suppose that is because you turned the thing off?” She crosses her arms. “Wanted to come say thanks.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.gotbetter>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.welcome>“You're welcome.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.welcome>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.anotherthing>“There's another thing. Because I was...unwell, I got booted from the crew I was with back then. I was thinking I could join up with you guys? I'm pretty handy with all things mechanical or electrical.” She looks strong and capable now that she's not being hindered by an external influence.</eventtext.badvibrations3.anotherthing>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.merrier>“Sure. The more the merrier.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.merrier>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.seeyouonboard>“Great. I'll see you on board.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.seeyouonboard>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.full>“Sorry, we're full for now.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.full>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.hangout>“Well, I guess I'll hang out here 'til I find something.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.hangout>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.reward>Ask for a reward.</eventtext.badvibrations3.reward>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.scrounge>“Oh. Uh, I can scrounge up a few hundred marks if you like. I'll send 'em to you as soon as possible.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.scrounge>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.o2>“You're the fortuneteller, right?”</eventtext.badvibrations3.o2>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.o2.c1>“Huh?” She looks confused and mildly annoyed. “No, you're mistaking me with someone else. I ran into you earlier when I was still having...trouble with a certain relic. You know, with the 'bad vibes' and all.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.o2.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.o2.o1>“Now I remember.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.o2.o1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor1.c1>A distressed looking person is pacing in circles in the hall. When they see you, their eyes light up. “You're from that sub that just docked, aren't you? Do you take passengers?”</eventtext.manandhisraptor1.c1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o1>“I am indeed. What type of passengers?”</eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o1.c1>“Just me and Rex. We're supposed to visit nana in the next town over, but for some reason nobody wants us on board.” The person can't keep eye contact for more than a second and keeps glancing over their shoulder.</eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o1.o1>Be suspicious.</eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o1.o1.c1>There are always vessels traveling these waters, eager to make some extra moolah by taking on passengers. You open your mouth, trying to voice your suspicions about the situation. “Wh—” you start, but the person interrupts you. “I'll pay you three thousand. One when we leave, two when we get there.”</eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor1.takeonboard>Take the person on board.</eventtext.manandhisraptor1.takeonboard>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor1.great>“Great!” they exclaim. “I'll get Rex and we'll meet you on board!” What a happy fellow. Hopefully their money is good.</eventtext.manandhisraptor1.great>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o2>“Nope.”</eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o2>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor2.c1>You're inspecting the sub when the person you talked to at the station peeks out from a cabin, with a wide smile on their face. “You ready to meet Rex?” Before you can utter a response, the biggest mudraptor you've ever seen jumps out behind them.</eventtext.manandhisraptor2.c1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor2.o1>“Watch out!”</eventtext.manandhisraptor2.o1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor2.o1.c1>You yell out and reach for a weapon, but the creature only tilts its head and looks at you quizzically. “Isn't he a cutie?” This is Rex? They brought a mudraptor on board? “Be careful, though. Rex gets ornery on long trips. Don't you, boy? Yes you do!” Great.</eventtext.manandhisraptor2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor2.c1.c1>Rex is pacing back and forth.</eventtext.manandhisraptor2.c1.c1>
<eventtext.heartofgold.c1>As you approach, this bandit throws down their weapon. “Ah fuck it, I give up. Don't shoot!”</eventtext.heartofgold.c1>
<eventtext.heartofgold.o1>“Too late for that. Say your prayers.”</eventtext.heartofgold.o1>
<eventtext.heartofgold.o1.c1>The bandit reaches for their weapon on the ground. “Do your worst!”</eventtext.heartofgold.o1.c1>
<eventtext.heartofgold.o2>Talk to them.</eventtext.heartofgold.o2>
<eventtext.heartofgold.o2.c1>“Thanks for not offing me, I guess.” The bandit squats down and wipes sweat off his brow. “I've never fired that, you know,” he says, pointing to the gun on the floor. “Not cut out for this shit.”</eventtext.heartofgold.o2.c1>
<eventtext.heartofgold.goodluck>“Well, good luck with everything.”</eventtext.heartofgold.goodluck>
<eventtext.heartofgold.wait>“Wait!” The bandit cries out and jumps to their feet. “Can I come with you? I know a lot about chemistry. I could cook you meds!”</eventtext.heartofgold.wait>
<eventtext.heartofgold.okay>“Okay, I suppose.”</eventtext.heartofgold.okay>
<eventtext.heartofgold.signingbonus>“All right! We can sort out a signing bonus later.”</eventtext.heartofgold.signingbonus>
<eventtext.heartofgold.whatamigonnado>“Well what am I gonna do then? Wait 'till another sub comes through guns blazing?”</eventtext.heartofgold.whatamigonnado>
<eventtext.heartofgold.onyourown>“You're on your own.”</eventtext.heartofgold.onyourown>
<eventtext.heartofgold.o2.o2>“What are you even doing here?”</eventtext.heartofgold.o2.o2>
<eventtext.heartofgold.o2.o2.c1>“I was captured along with the rest of my crew and sub. They're all gone now.” They scowl. “Eaten. They were used as bait for the crawlers that used to inhabit this place. I was spared because I know how to make morphine and fent.”</eventtext.heartofgold.o2.o2.c1>
<eventtext.heartofgold.o2.o2.o1>“You're a drug dealer?”</eventtext.heartofgold.o2.o2.o1>
<eventtext.heartofgold.o2.o2.o1.c1>“Give me a break. Like you haven't done any opiates yourself? The way I see it I provided a service and, in return, nobody pointed a gun my way.” A dry smile creeps on their face. “Until you, that is.”</eventtext.heartofgold.o2.o2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.c1>“Hey, you there.”</eventtext.bombscare.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1>“Me?”</eventtext.bombscare.o1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.c1>The guard takes a long look at you. “Never mind. I thought you looked like someone else. You're free to go.”</eventtext.bombscare.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1>“What's going on?”</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.c1>“Just be careful,” the guard cautions. “We received a bomb threat a few hours ago, by some usual suspects. It's been a while and no bomb has been found, but we advise caution.”</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1>“Usual suspects?”</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1>The guard lowers their voice. “Look, you better stay clear of this separatist business. There have been some serious attacks lately. Just come to me if you see something suspicious.”</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>Out of the corner of your eye, you see a pile of scrap electronics.</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1>Salvage.</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>To your surprise, the pile of scrap turns out to be a homemade pipe bomb. As luck would have it some wires have come loose, preventing the bomb from going off. You carefully remove the detonator, pick up the bomb and place it in your bag. The guard from earlier should be interested in seeing this.</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1.c1>You thrust the bomb to the arms of the guard, who flinches a bit. You recount your experience and the guard thanks you for finding the bomb and gives you a small reward for dismantling it.</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c2>To your surprise, the pile of scrap is wired to a timer. You turn it around and see “00:01” displayed on the timer.</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1>Take cover.</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1>You drop the bomb and dive down onto the floor, covering your head with your hands. Seconds pass by, but nothing happens. Gingerly, you stand up and dust yourself off. Seems like this bomb is a dud. The guard from earlier should be interested in seeing this.</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1.c1>You report finding a bomb in the hallway and the guard immediately springs to action. They thank you for finding and reporting the bomb.</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o2>Leave the guard.</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o2>
<eventtext.terrorism101.c1>You see a person crouched next to a vending machine, assembling or fixing something.</eventtext.terrorism101.c1>
<eventtext.terrorism101.o1>Find out what they're working on.</eventtext.terrorism101.o1>
<eventtext.terrorism101.o1.c1>You sneak behind the person and crane your neck. It seems they're fiddling with some kind of a device with lots of wires. They glance back and jump up when they see you. “Shit! Don't just stand there!”</eventtext.terrorism101.o1.c1>
<eventtext.terrorism101.o1.o1>“Sorry.”</eventtext.terrorism101.o1.o1>
<eventtext.terrorism101.o1.o1.c1>“It's all right, I guess.” They check their pulse and exhale deeply. “I've been a wreck ever since my medication was pulled. Couldn't afford it, they said. Then they went ahead and installed these fuckin' things.” Irate, the dweller kicks the vending machine.</eventtext.terrorism101.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.terrorism101.o1.o1.o1>“So what are you doing?”</eventtext.terrorism101.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.terrorism101.excuse>“I, uh...” Their eyes dart around, looking for something. “I'm building a, um...” They're sweating profusely.</eventtext.terrorism101.excuse>
<eventtext.terrorism101.abomb>“A bomb?”</eventtext.terrorism101.abomb>
<eventtext.terrorism101.shh>“SHHH! Not so loud!” they hiss. Then they continue, whispering. “Yes, it's a bomb. But it's also so much more. It's a symbol of discontent against our overlords. We must topple the monuments of oppression, like this one here.” They spit on the vending machine. “But that's hypothetical at this point, 'cause I don't actually know how to arm this symbol.”</eventtext.terrorism101.shh>
<eventtext.terrorism101.help>“I could help you with that.”</eventtext.terrorism101.help>
<eventtext.terrorism101.novice>The novice terrorist scrutinizes you for a minute, then warily hands you a bunch of wires. “I think I can trust you,” they say.</eventtext.terrorism101.novice>
<eventtext.terrorism101.armbomb>Arm the bomb.</eventtext.terrorism101.armbomb>
<eventtext.terrorism101.bombarmed>It's only a matter of connecting the detonator wire to get the bomb armed. You hand the bomb to the person and they give you some change and a promise to talk you up to their Separatist friends.</eventtext.terrorism101.bombarmed>
<eventtext.terrorism101.dismantlebomb>Quietly dismantle the bomb.</eventtext.terrorism101.dismantlebomb>
<eventtext.terrorism101.bombdismantled>You pretend to arm the bomb, but instead you remove some of the wires, making sure the bomb can't go off. The person hands you some change as a reward and promises to talk you up to their Separatist friends.</eventtext.terrorism101.bombdismantled>

<eventtext.terrorism101.o1.o2.o2>“Never mind. I'm getting the guards.”</eventtext.terrorism101.o1.o2.o2>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.c1>This colony is in a hurry. Lots of workers are loading supplies onto submarines.  You see a pair of them arguing quietly and gesturing toward you.</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1>Walk up to them.</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.c1>On your approach, the pair instantly quiets down. Up close you can see an anarchist patch on one of their jackets, revealing them to be separatists. “Didn't you help us out earlier?” the other asks.</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1>“Yep, that's me.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.c1>“You see all that crew running around? A lot of subs here are readying for a dive.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1>“I wonder where they're going.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Yeah, so do we. We sent one of ours to the office to find out.” The speaker shifts their weight and pauses for a bit. “They haven't come back yet, and I'm getting worried. Might've been caught doing something they shouldn't have.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1>“I could find out.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Not a bad idea. Officials here don't know you yet. Just sneak in, see what you can see. Whatever it is, don't cause a scene.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“Wouldn't dream of it.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Oh, and if our guy ask you if you've had Versas liver, the answer is 'It's to die for.'”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“Got it.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>Peeking into a side room, you see somebody sitting on a chair, handcuffed. Judging by their bloody and swollen face, they've been roughed up pretty thoroughly.</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Check on them.</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>The person is semi-delirious, but they manage to mutter a question: “You ever...ever had V-versas liver?”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“No, never.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“S-shame. I hear it's to die for.” They chuckle to themselves. “You better leave before s-security comes back. If you could let somebody know I'm in here, it'd be s-swell.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>You inform the separatists of the location of their agent. They thank you for your help and set out to rescue their comrade.</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>“It's to die for.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>“Take th-the scrap of paper from my pocket. M-make s-sure it makes it to safe hands. I better stay here or the pigs smell something's going on.” You take the paper and stuff it in your pocket.</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1.c1>You hand the intel to the separatist. “Damn. This isn't much to go on. The only thing this proves is that the Coalition has started mobilizing en masse and they're searching for something. I could've told you that by just looking around. Thanks for your help anyway. If you'll excuse me, we have a rescue mission to undertake.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o2>“Damn, that sucks. Good luck though.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o2>“Nope, you must be mistaken.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o2>
<eventtext.censorship.c1>“Hey, psst!” You hear a sharp whisper from behind. A person in a clown costume is trying to get your attention.</eventtext.censorship.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1>Listen to what they have to say.</eventtext.censorship.o1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.c1>They seem grateful that you're willing to hear them out, but under all that white makeup, you can't be sure. The person is really fidgety and every time they shift, their shoes squeak loudly.</eventtext.censorship.o1.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.c1>You manage to gather that a shipment of important materials has been falsely impounded from this clown person's vessel and they're asking for help getting it back.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1>Help them out.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1>The jester is overjoyed. The box has been taken to the manager's office. They toot a horn as you turn to leave. Weird.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>There is a box of supplies here, labeled “Confiscated.” This must be what the clown wanted. You bend down and pick up the box, then turn around to head back when you see a security guard pointing at you with a stun baton. “Where do you think you're going? That's confiscated materials you're carrying.”</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1>Be truthful.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>You explain that you're helping someone get their unlawfully confiscated cargo back. “Unlawfully? Do you realize you're carrying highly dangerous implements of terror there?” The guard carefully opens the box, revealing a bunch of red and white costumes and an assortment of bike horns.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1>“I'm sorry, officer. I didn't know.”</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1>The guard takes the box from you. “Don't let me catch you trying that shit again.”</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2>Run.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.c1>Without saying another word, you turn tail and run. The officer is stunned for a moment, then chases after you.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2>Lie.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.c1>You explain that you are a new customs officer here and are transporting the box to a more secure facility.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1>The guard scratches their head.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c1>The guard decides it's not worth their time to fact-check what you said. They wave you to continue on.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c1.c1>The clown is happy to see their items back and teaches you a customary clown greeting that you can use to impress other clowns.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c2>The guard is not convinced and takes the box from you.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c2>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c2.c2>Sadly, you return to the clown empty-handed.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c2.c2>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o2>Better not.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o2>

<eventtext.atwitsend.c1>A gaunt young man walks up to you, a bottle of liquor in hand. Despite appearances, he speaks to you in a peppy tune:\n\n"Hey, the name's Artie Dolittle. You came here on that ship, right? You should take me with you!"\n</eventtext.atwitsend.c1>
<eventtext.atwitsend.o1>“What? Why should I do that?”</eventtext.atwitsend.o1>
<eventtext.atwitsend.o1.c1>“Because I'd be a great employee! I'm good at everything and I'll even work for free! How's that sound?”</eventtext.atwitsend.o1.c1>
<eventtext.atwitsend.o1.o1>“You've convinced me. Welcome aboard.”</eventtext.atwitsend.o1.o1>
<eventtext.atwitsend.o1.o1.c1>“Great! You won't regret it.”</eventtext.atwitsend.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.atwitsend.o1.o2>“Not interested.”</eventtext.atwitsend.o1.o2>
<eventtext.atwitsend.o1.o2.c1>“Oh. Can't blame a guy for trying though, right?”</eventtext.atwitsend.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.atwitsend.o2>“Nah, get lost, you bum.”</eventtext.atwitsend.o2>
<eventtext.atwitsend.o2.c1>“Well screw you, then!”</eventtext.atwitsend.o2.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1>A passing scientist grabs hold of you. “It lives! Who would've thought it would ever live?” Their eyes are wide open and sporting impressive bags under them.</EventText.captivesouls.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.o1>”What are you talking about?”</EventText.captivesouls.o1>
<EventText.captivesouls.o1.c1>“I was too preoccupied with asking 'Can I?' instead of 'Should I?'” They pace back and forth, directing each word to a different passerby. When it becomes clear to them nobody's paying any attention besides you, they turn their attention back toward you.</EventText.captivesouls.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.o1.o1.c1>“Are you not listening to me?” the hysterical researcher bellows, sending drops of spittle across your face. “A human-crawler hybrid! Oh, it's beautiful! No! Hideous!” They sit down, cross-legged on the floor. “How will the scientific community remember me? As a creator? A destroyer?” they pose to no one in particular. “Dare I say...a god?”</EventText.captivesouls.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.o1.o1.o1.c1>Looking at the scientist—now writhing on the floor, gibbering and laughing to themself—you are somewhat grateful that the end comes in your line of work quickly and violently, instead of a slow spiral to madness.</EventText.captivesouls.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>Their claims of having successfully bred a human-crawler hybrid are obviously fantastical. Although... There is a small part of you that wants to believe. Maybe you could check the lab, just in case?</EventText.captivesouls.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.c1>A crawler is sitting motionless in a tank.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1>Approach.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.c1>It seems to have been heavily sedated. This is not unordinary. Researchers are known to catch live specimens for research. Numerous scientific breakthroughs have been made using data received from crawlers: medical, gastronomical, psychologica— Wait. Did it just...blink?</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1>Knock on the glass.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.c1>You tap on the glass three times and the creature opens its eyes. They are remarkably blue and fixated on you. It blinks once, twice… You can't help but feel like the creature is trying to communicate.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1>What is it saying?</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Free me.” (You shouldn't.)</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1>True, I shouldn't. Although...</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>It is a living creature, after all. Why shouldn't it be granted clemency?</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Smash the glass.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>It takes a few swings to make a crack appear. The water crashes out along with the creature, who turns its head toward you and nods, before slithering into a vent and disappearing from view. Weird. Did it acknowledge your help, or was it simply a jerky movement on its part?</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>A glint catches your eye in the now empty, broken tank.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Check it out.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>Among the debris, there is a small trinket with alien etchings. You take it. It's time to go before someone starts asking questions.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>No time.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>

<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>You decide to leave the creature in its tank.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>

<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o2>Don't approach.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o2>
<EventText.explosivemishap.c1>You hear voices from behind a closed door. “...so I just hold down this button?”</EventText.explosivemishap.c1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1>Listen at the door.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.c1>A low humming voice can be heard in the background, like an old-timey vacuum cleaner. “Basically. Though you should be careful not to overheat it.”</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.c1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.c1>“Overheat?” The humming noise grows louder and louder, increasing in pitch.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1>Keep your ear to the door.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.c1>The door is blown off its hinges, knocking you down.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1>Look inside.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>It looks as if a bomb had gone off inside the laboratory. Expensive instruments are strewn broken on the floor and the once-white walls are decorated with streaks of dark red and pieces of brain matter. Two smoking corpses lie on the floor, along with an alien device of some kind. Someone nearby is yelling for a security guard.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Examine the device before security gets here.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>The device is made of black metallic material and is heavy to hold. There is a handle that your hand fits into, and a button that lies directly under your index finger.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Pull the trigger.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>Nothing happens. It seems if this item indeed is the cause of the mess here, it has run dry of its destructive power.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Look for anything else useful in the lab.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You find a shiny capsule that fits into a slot on the underside of the device. You hear footsteps approaching. If you want to keep the device for yourself, it's time to bounce.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>

<EventText.occupationalhazards.c1>A man with a hard hat is nursing a drink.</EventText.occupationalhazards.c1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1>Join him.</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.c1>You pull a seat next to him and he acknowledges you with a nod. “Here to work?”</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.c1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1>“Something like that.”</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.c1>He chuckles. “Had you pegged as the type. Well, if you're thinking of heading into the mines, don't,” he says and finishes his drink in one gulp.</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1>“What's in the mines?”</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Well,” the worker starts, is interrupted by a hiccup, and continues: “Not any miners with two brain cells to rub together, that's for sure. Not during breeding season.”</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.o1>“Breeding season?”</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>The worker grunts an affirmation. “But when the boss says 'drill' you drill, or you go without food. So I went deeper until I hit something.”</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“What did you hit?”</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>

<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“So, is there a reward for clearing them out?”</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>The man bursts into laughter. “No. What are you, some kind of a monster hunter?

<EventText.hognose.c1>You see a man with an eyepatch and a white beard sitting at a table. Some passersby are casting nervous side-eye glances at him. “That's Hognose Huber, sea captain extraordinaire,” someone whispers.</EventText.hognose.c1>
<EventText.hognose.o1>Approach.</EventText.hognose.o1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.c1>The man growls as you approach.</EventText.hognose.o1.c1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1>”Not too friendly, are we?”</EventText.hognose.o1.o1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.c1>He hacks up something from his throat and spits it out. “Had a bit of a blockage. Help you?” Huber squints at you.</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1>”I was wondering how one gets a nickname like Hognose.”</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Hognose was the name of my ship. Used to run the Hettol-Ihesas-Urghstead circuit.” He sits up, beaming with pride. “Must've had a hundred successful transports. Meds, military ordnance, submarine parts, you name it, I hauled it.”</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1>”Then what happened?”</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“What happened? It got sunk! By Moping Jack!” Hognose pounds the table with his fist, sending empty glasses flying. “Caught me totally by surprise. One hit, the engine was down. Second, the hull was breached.” He stares through you, into the distance.</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>”How did you survive?”</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“I swam,” Hognose states matter-of-factly. “Grabbed all the O2 I could and hopped on a scooter. Had to even leave Ringo, my pet toad, behind.” A single tear rolls down from Hognose's remaining eye. “At that moment I swore revenge against the beast.” He slams down a radio on the table. Noticing your puzzled look, he explains. “It ate my radio mast. I've been all over Europa, trying to get a signal. If I ever find him, it's—” The radio lets out a series of beeps.</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“It's here! You have a ship, don't you? Up for a hunt, young one?” Hognose is shaking with excitement. “Well compensated of course.”</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>”Of course!”</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“I knew there was a fight in your generation after all! I'll see you on board.”</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>Not interested.</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o2>”Never mind.”</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o2>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o2>Run away.</EventText.hognose.o1.o2>
<EventText.hognose.o2>Steer clear.</EventText.hognose.o2>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.c1>An elderly woman waves at you. “Could you be a dear and throw this out for me?” she asks, shoving a handful of trash in your hand.</EventText.nothingtoseehere.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1>Do as she asks.</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.c1>You're glad to be rid of the old hag's garbage. While unloading your smelly cargo you catch a glimpse of a human finger amid the refuse.</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1>Investigate further.</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.c1>Being up to your elbows in the trash can draws some weird looks from onlookers but they shrug it off. The economy is bad after all. Under all the burger wrappers you can see a lanyard identifying the corpse as a reporter for The Europan, a newspaper of questionable quality. Curiously, their name is scratched out.</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1>You try not to gag at the smell of the garbage and the dead body and rip the tag off. Maybe somebody in security would be interested in this?</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>“Can I help you with something?”</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1>”I'd like to report a dead body.”</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>You show the name tag to the security officer and explain your findings. They scratch their head and sigh. “Look, I've been working security for fifteen years. If a line cook at Irma Burger is found dead, it's probably a crime of passion, an argument gone wrong,” they explain. “The killer may be found, justice dispensed.” They take a look around. Nobody seems to be listening, but the guard continues in whisper: “A reporter is found in the trash, their ID scratched out? You turn a blind eye. There's nothing good to be found in that rabbit hole.”</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1>”Understood.”</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1>The guard raises their voice again. “Thank you for your tip, citizen. Five hunded marks have been deposited to your account.”</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2>Prod for more information.</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.c1>To the guard's dismay, you ask them to elaborate. “Do I need to spell this out for you? Reporters investigate—” Somebody walks by you, and the guard stops mid-sentence, waits for them to pass, then continues: “and more importantly, they report. Somebody clearly didn't want to be reported on.”</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.o1>”Somebody from the Coalition?”</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.o1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.o1.c1>The guard rolls their eyes. “You finally get it. There's a nice reward for reporting a dead body. I suggest you take that, buy yourself some opium, or whatever it is you submarine types like and forget about what you saw. I'll take care of the body.”</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.o1.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2>Chicken out.</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.c1>"What kind of idiot would interrupt our undergoing experiment in the post-ascension stage?!"</eventtext.huskextremists1.c1>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o1>"You've done all this on purpose?!"</eventtext.huskextremists1.o1>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.c1>"Ah, of course it's a non-believer. Look around, open your eyes. Have you noticed society is slowly crumbling? Food on outposts is scarce, populations are thinning."</eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1>"So you decided to speed up our demise?"</eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1.c1>"Our demise? No! Our salvation. Humankind's only way to move beyond slowly being wiped out is by adapting. And the way to adapt is through the Velonaceps calyx, or Husk as you would call it. It takes us beyond the limits of our frail human bodies, makes us something more. A sacrifice now means less deaths in the long-term—probably even preventing the extinction of our whole race! By whatever means necessary!"</eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1.o1>"The Husk may be the way forward, but not like this… Through voluntary experiments and real science in labs, we'll find our way."</eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1.o2>"We will find a way to survive. I'd prefer it to be without a parasite in my throat."</eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1.o3>"You may have a point… We'll leave you be."</eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1.o3>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o2>"Brothers, you are clearly misguided. The mess you've made here isn't what an Ascension looks like."</eventtext.huskextremists1.o2>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o2.c1>"Oh, so you're one of the cowards who pretend to be on the way to Ascension, but are too afraid to take a proper dive to the deep end? Perhaps we need to silence those weak little human thoughts and give you a little push over the edge?"</eventtext.huskextremists1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o3>"The kind that has a post-shotgun to the face experiment prepared for you."</eventtext.huskextremists1.o3>

<!-- Campaign meta texts -->
<campaignstart>In the late 20th century, it was discovered that under the icy, irradiated surface of Jupiter's moon Europa lies a vast sea capable of sustaining life. This discovery sent shockwaves through the scientific community.\n\nIn the year 2022, the first manned space flight arrived on Europa to discover that the moon was indeed already sustaining life, in the form of hostile sub-aquatic fauna. Besides the wildlife, the researchers faced gruelling difficulties posed by the dangerous radiation emitted from Jupiter and the intense cold and tremendous pressure of the Europan ocean.\n\nDespite all their hardships, Earth-born colonists were able to construct a handful of habitable outposts where a new way of life developed over many decades. A new system of governance was formed by a coalition of the largest, most influential cities on the moon. Different industries made their mark in the new world, including mining, manufacturing and chemical laboratories.\n\nOver the years, Europan society became more and more dissociated from Earth. Fifty years ago, contact was lost entirely, and no more supply ships have arrived since.\n\nSub-aquatic travel and vehicles are in a key role in this new society, scouting for new inhabitable locations, protecting citizens from creature attacks and establishing supply lines between stations as humanity ventures ever deeper to evade the lethal radiation from Jupiter above. The life of a crewmember aboard one of these submarines is a lucrative one, albeit dangerous and often short.\n\nYou have enlisted to serve on a yyyy-class submarine, docked at xxxx. The waters of Europa open up before you—explore, help expand the colonies, and make of this place what you will.</campaignstart>
<campaignend1>Hints of what are to come flash before your eyes: a crystalline space, something coiled within itself slumbering fitfully. But you are not yet ready to fully experience this. Your fate is still being woven by the Undertow.</campaignend1>
<campaignend4>Everything fades to black in this moment... You've just been commissioned by the Europa Coalition at xxxx to serve aboard a yyyy class sub. The waters of Europa open up before you, ever deadlier. A sense of déjà vu overcomes you—have you done this all before?</campaignend4>
<campaignend5>Having reached the end, your adventure restarts from a new beginning, this time with greater peril in store for you.</campaignend5>
<shrinkingmap>As the intensity of the Jovian radiation effect increases, shallower regions of Europa will gradually become uninhabitable and unsafe to travel. Make your way to deeper waters to avoid it.</shrinkingmap>

<EosIntro0>Following Barotrauma’s release on Epic Games Store, Barotrauma uses Epic Online Services (EOS) to enable crossplay between Steam and Epic Games Store users. Crossplay between platforms makes it possible to host and join servers seamlessly between players on Steam and Epic.</EosIntro0>
<EosIntro1>To enable crossplay, you are not required to create an Epic Games account. However, the crossplay feature requires sharing your SteamID and display name with the EOS backend. Additionally, joining servers hosted by Epic players may also require Steam authentication tickets to be sent to the host to verify your identity using your SteamID (and if applicable, such as when playing Barotrauma through Steam Family Sharing, the SteamID of the account that owns the copy of Barotrauma that you are using).</EosIntro1>
<EosIntro2>By enabling crossplay, you agree that your Steam account will be registered in EOS’ backend for authentication purposes.</EosIntro2>
<EosIntro3>You can disable crossplay later at any time by toggling the relevant option in the Gameplay &amp; UI tab in the settings menu.</EosIntro3>

<EventText.firingblanks.c2>You tinkered a bit with the coilgun's ammunition box, meaning it's now utterly useless to kill enemies with. For good measure, you installed some bike horns in there, because why not. If the bike horns sound, you know your prank was successful.</EventText.firingblanks.c2>

<EventText.clobberyrobbery.c2>Welp.

<eventname.poweredbyfaith>Powered by Faith</eventname.poweredbyfaith>
<EventText.poweredbyfaith.c1>You wake up from a fever dream. Beads of sweat have collected on your forehead, but you're not bothered by all that. You still remember your dream vividly, and it must have had some meaning to it. In it, a person taken over by the husk infection slowly approached you, and you had no way to move—your limbs were completely frozen. But! Instead of brutally attacking and murdering you, the Velonaceps calyx radiated calmness and compassion. They WANT to save us, if we'll let them!\n\nAs long as we show our faith and truly BELIEVE, we can do anything. Although your crew is full of blasphemous non-believers, you'll ensure the submarine will be turned into a temple worthy of the husks' blessing. You do hope you might enlist some people to your cause, though.\n\nStudies have shown that believing in husks as saviors can be linked to an interest in [codeword]. Mentioning [codeword] might find you some allies.</EventText.poweredbyfaith.c1>
<EventText.poweredbyfaith.c2>One of your crewmembers was having a fever dream last night; you could hear their shouts and screams followed by an eerie calmness and murmurs of “praise the husks.”Seems like someone found their religion in their dreams and, you won't lie, you're kinda into that. Lacking any kind of conviction yourself, you often look for others to follow, sometimes just to interrupt the tedious day-to-day grind. Sounds like you found yourself a new temporary source of entertainment.\n\nStudies have shown that believing in husks as saviors can be linked to an interest in [codeword]. Mentioning [codeword] might get you involved.</EventText.poweredbyfaith.c2>
<EventText.poweredbyfaith.c3>You found a miraculously infinite stash of husk figurines! Surely a sign you're on the right track. Better inform your fellow cultists of this…</EventText.poweredbyfaith.c3>
<EventText.poweredbyfaith.c4>The submarine has been transformed into a temple worshipping the Velonaceps calyx, and rather tastefully too. However, clearly this is not enough, as a new idea popped into your head: Prove the power of the husks by replacing the fuel rod in the reactor with a husk figurine.</EventText.poweredbyfaith.c4>
<EventText.poweredbyfaith.c5>Guess your faith in the husks might have been a bit overrated and not actually capable of magically fueling the nuclear reactor. That's not really part of the Church of Husk's faith anyways, you remember now. Oh well, it was just a fever dream, after all. Time to move on.</EventText.poweredbyfaith.c5>

<EventText.huskroulette.c1>You were contacted by the Church of Husk: “We acknowledge having a symbiote growing inside your throat may be a bit scary for some people, so we would like to research the psychological effects of the threat of the husk infection, in order to be able to treat it effectively…”\n\nAttached with the message were three syringes, two of which don't do anything, one of which contains the Velonaceps calyx in advanced stages.

<EventText.gnawingcold.c1>Tack-tack-tack-tack. With chattering teeth you practically embrace the somewhat heated pipes running along the walls of the submarine. The chill air sends shivers through your spine, and you frantically try to rub your hands together before they go numb. “Why is it always so darned cold here?” you think to yourself. “Would turning up the heating just a tiny bit really hurt our fuel consumption?!”\n\nIn the distance, you see a fellow crewmember buried in blankets, and hear a familiar sound: “tack-tack-tack.” Perhaps together you could heat up the submarine?\n\nYou vaguely recall someone else complaining about the cold earlier on the radio too. Perhaps you could all heat up the submarine? Use the codeword “[codeword]” to find the other freezing crewmates.</EventText.gnawingcold.c1>
